    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time for another book review. This time of Michael Heap&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484216606">Ansible: From Beginner to Pro</a>,
published by <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a>. The 200 page book is, as the
name suggests, about the orchestration tool Ansible. It&rsquo;s a tool that I don&rsquo;t
have any previous experience of, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying it out in
the real world! Now, let&rsquo;s jump into it!</p>

<p>For being such a short book it covers quite a few topics. It assumes no
previous knowledge, and starts from the very beginning. It then walks through
the various components of Ansible projects, like inventory files (files
containing lists of hosts to run Ansible against), roles and how to write your
own modules with Python. The explanations are clear, and throughout the book a
running example (consisting of a WordPress installation) is used to demonstrate
the different topics. The nice tone and spacious layout also contributes to make
reading the book a pleasant experience, and I managed to read the full thing
cover to cover in about a weekend without trying too hard.</p>

<p>So, are there anything that&rsquo;s not that great about the book? Well, I had issues
with a few steps along the way, and while I did manage to solve I would&rsquo;ve
liked some form of guidance from the book. It doesn&rsquo;t cover troubleshooting at
all, which come to think of it none of the other books I&rsquo;ve reviewed have
either (I particularly remember trying desperately to understand the Haskell
error messages I got when reading <em>Learn you a Haskell</em>, which are all quite
cryptic). It was a while since I read the book, so I don&rsquo;t remember specifically
what the issues where, but I do remember that for a beginner like myself the
solution wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious. Apart from this I have no big issues with
the book. I enjoyed both it and the tool quite a bit, and I hope the other
books from Apress have the same standard (I have a few in my backlog).</p>

<p>Now, on to the big question: Am I an Ansible pro now? After all, that&rsquo;s
what the book&rsquo;s name suggests I should be. To be fair, I think that <em>pro</em>
might be a slight exaggeration. While I think that I could probably orchestrate
a server reasonably well using Ansible at this point, there&rsquo;s still a lot to
learn. The book mentions some best practices for various parts of the tool, but
my experience from other areas tell me that while I may understand these, it&rsquo;ll
take a bit of active use of the tool before they&rsquo;re fully internalized. That
being said, I do believe that I know enough to orchestrate a server. And I will
    soon know for sure; I bought a VPS recently and I plan to orchestrate it using
Ansible, both for simplicity and for practice. This will happen sometime during
the coming week, so I&rsquo;ll get back to you then. I also have some neat ideas
regarding orchestrating localhost that I want to try out, so and I&rsquo;ll let you
read all about it once I&rsquo;ve given it a go.</p>

<p>To conclude, would I recommend this book? If you&rsquo;re a sysadmin on any level,
be it on a hobby level like me or a professional level like not me, yes. It&rsquo;s
a tool that makes the setting up of a server a lot easier, and the fact that
you can dry-run your playbooks in a virtual environment without any fuzz is
great. If you&rsquo;re not a sysadmin I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it though. It&rsquo;s a pleasant
read nonetheless, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get much out of it. Unless, of
course, my little experiment works. Then you might want to have a look at it
for ricing reasons. We&rsquo;ll see I guess. Until then!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, here we are agian. Yet another change of blogging platform. This one is
here to stay, at least of a while. I promise.</p>

<p>So why do I change once again? Well, the reason is simple: time. I have a lot
of things I <em>want</em> to add to my old blog, like commenting and possibly RSS and
stuff, but I don&rsquo;t really have the time. So I went looking for a suitable
platform, and found this. Like my old blog this renders Markdown, but it also
does syntax highlighting and stuff more efficiently than my old blog. So this
is what I&rsquo;ll go with.</p>

<p>Am I going to abandon my old blog then? No, not quite. I don&rsquo;t plan on using
it as my blogging platform anytime in the near future, but I do plan to keep it
alive and well inside a VM and keep developing it. So maybe I&rsquo;ll use it again
in the future, who knows? But for now it&rsquo;s only going to be a side project, the
progress of which I&rsquo;ll share here.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;m going to migrate all the old posts to this
platform, but it might take a bit of time because of formatting differences
and stuff. Until next time!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
