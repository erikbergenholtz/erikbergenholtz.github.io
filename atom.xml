    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This review was supposed to be published some months ago (in July last year,
to be specific), but wasn&rsquo;t because I put it in a folder where I&rsquo;d be sure to
find it again and then, of course, didn&rsquo;t. So if there&rsquo;s anything in there that
doesn&rsquo;t make sense in the context of having read the book now, rather than
during last year&rsquo;s vacation, it&rsquo;s because I did read it during last year&rsquo;s
vacation. Regardless, I stand by my opinion on the book, so here&rsquo;s the review.</em></p>

<p>Here it is. My review of <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm">Hacking - The Art of Exploitation</a></em>
by Jon Erickson, published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com">No Starch Press</a> (of
course). It&rsquo;s a book I first learned about many a year ago when I first got
interested for real in computer security, so somewhere around seven years ago.
Like <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em>, this is one of <em>the</em> books to read as an asipring
hacker according to the hacker community (at least it was back then). I bought
a copy of the book 2013, and it&rsquo;s been gathering dust on my bookshelf since. But
now, finally, I&rsquo;ve read it. So what are we waiting for, let&rsquo;s jump right in!</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em>, which tries to be an introduction to many fields of
security, <em>The Art of Exploitation</em> tries to be an introduction to one aspect of
security, namely writing exploits. As a result, it goes further into depth in
this one subject than <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em> does in any subject, including
programming. A fundamental part of writing exploits is to understand how
computers work at a low level, and <em>The Art of Exploitation</em> aims to teach you
just that. Because of this, the first 100 pages of the book covers C programming
and some general x86 assymbly. I&rsquo;m aware that I gave <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em> a bit
of a bashing for covering programming, because I believe that you should know
programming before getting into hacking, but here it&rsquo;s much more in depth and
well explained. <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em> stopped at showing off if-statements and
for-loops, while <em>Art of Exploitation</em> goes all the way to dynamic memory,
function pointers, structs and file access. It also shows some of the basics of
GDB, end explains the stack, the heap and the different memory segments that are
used in a program. All in all, I believe that if you read the first chapter
carefully, do some exercises and write some programs yourself, you&rsquo;d be pretty
confident with C afterwards. Granted, you&rsquo;ll have to put down time to actually
learn how to write programs from a specification of course, but at least you
would know how to write the code once the structure of it is determined.</p>

<p>The rest of the book is more or less dedicated to exploiting. The second chapter
shows how a number of exploits like buffer overflows and fromat string exploits
work, and it does so by example. Accompanying the book is a LiveCD with an
Ubuntu installation containing all the tools and code used in the book. All
examples are walked through, step by step, and clearly show how to find the
vulnerability in the given program, how to construct the exploit and how to
execute it. The chapter following this takes this to the next level by adding
networking to the mix. It starts off by talking about networks in general,
explaining the OSI model layer by layer, and then moves on to some network
programming using both the <code>socket()</code> interface in C, as well as more abstract
libraries like <code>libnet</code> and <code>libpcap</code>. It finally explains how to write tools
for things like DoS attacks, ARP spoofing and TCP/IP hijacking. Once networking
is covered, the book moves on to showing how to write your own shellcode, as up
to this point all the shellcode has been predesigned to do the right thing. It
goes through how to use syscalls to do what you want, how to open up shells,
bind shells to network connections, and how to optimize the shellcode. Next,
countermeasures are covered as well as ways around these countermeasures.
Finally, a brief and high level introduction to cryprology is given, which shows
off how to break RC4 (the cryptographic function used by WEP) among other
things.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the book does cover a lot of things, but it&rsquo;s still quite
focused. Most of the exploits that are shown are based on the idea of injecting
code into a running program, and redirecting the execution of the program to the
injected code. Because of this, and the fact that all the exploits are written
by the reader and not just executed by a prebuilt tool, the book doesn&rsquo;t feel
too spread out and also manages to convey understanding on the subjects, rather
than being a glorified manpage. Apart from this, the text is also quite
approachable, which makes it easy to take in the information. The examples are
worked through step by step, showing all the steps along the way, and the steps
are clearly explained. Many of the programs being exploited are quite trivial
and have blindingly obvious flaws, but the point of the book is not to become a
1337 h4xXx0R^ that can <a href="https://youtu.be/Bmz67ErIRa4">hack the Gibson</a>, but to
get the reader into the mindset of a hacker and to know what kinds of flaws to
look for when trying to find exploits in real life software. This is something
it does a great job with.</p>

<p>One thing you might&rsquo;ve noticed is that I mentioned that all the code is readily
available on the supplied LiveCD, but I didn&rsquo;t complain about it like I did with
<em>Black Hat Python</em>. This might seem hypocritical, but I have my reasons for
thinking it&rsquo;s okay with this book. Firtly, most of the things that the book
actually tries to teach you are concepts that can&rsquo;t really be put into code.
Sure, you can just read the book, see all the examples in GDB that are shown in
the book, and then pat yourself on the back for becoming a hacker. But if you
want to actually try running any of the exploits to see them in action, you&rsquo;ll
have to do some work yourself as memory addresses changes. Moreover, most of
the supplied code is either shellcode that you need prebuilt until the fourth
chapter of book, or programs that you&rsquo;ll try to exploit. Writing these yourself
if of course very good exercise, but for someone like me who knows programming
quite well and just want to learn how to write exploit, having to write the
500 line web server myself would just be a distraction. Having the code
available, ready to be compiled, lets you focus on what the book actually is
about. Another redeeming factor is that the book actually explains what&rsquo;s being
attempted <em>before</em> showing the code in the book, so you can give it a go first.
Because of these things, I appreciate the code being available.</p>

<p>So, to wrap this up, did I learn something, and who would I recommend this to?
The answer to the first question is undoubtably &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I learned quite a bit.
I knew of most attacks since before, but reading this gave me a better
understanding of why they work, and how. I also learned that I need to get
better at assembler, because optimizing shellcode for both size and to remove
NULL-bytes can be a bit tricky. In other words, expect a review on an ASM book
some time in the future. The answer to the second question is a bit more tricky.
On the one hand I think this is a book that, in part at least, would benefit
everyone who does software development at some level. On the other hand it might
be a bit too in-depth if your only goal is to understand how the exploits work
on a high level to know what to avoid doing. Because of this, I think I&rsquo;m going
to settle for the answer that anyone who is interested in security should read
this book, everyone else might want to skim some of it but maybe not read the
whole thing cover to cover. Also, I do think that because of the thorough
introduction to programming in the beginning, as long as you&rsquo;re taking the time
to work through everything and not just use the prebuilt code, people of any
level should be able to follow reasonably well. I do still think you should have
a firm grasp of how computers work <em>before</em> you delve into security though.</p>

<p>That being said, I am now off to do.. other things. I&rsquo;m thinking of picking up
<em>Web application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</em> and work through that, or try to find a nice
VM with juicy vulnerabilities to practice on. Regardless, I&rsquo;ll see you later!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[2018 Bucket List - January Progress]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/02/03/2018-bucket-list-january-progress/"/>
    <updated>2018-02-03T22:49:50+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/02/03/2018-bucket-list-january-progress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There we are. The first month of 2018 has passed, and so it is time for me to
revisit the <a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/01/03/bucket-list-of-2018/">bucket list</a>
I made back in the beginning of the year. So the big question is what&rsquo;s happened
during this month? Unfortunately, not as much as I wished would happen. But
that&rsquo;s alright, because we&rsquo;ve got another 11 months to go before all these
things are supposed to be ticked off.</p>

<p>What has happeden though is that I have finished reading <em>The Grabeyard Book</em>, I
have finished <em>Mario Odyssey</em> (or, well, the main part of the game anyway, I
know there&rsquo;s more content to unlock by slaving away with collecting star shaped
power moons, but I&rsquo;m not going to count that), and I&rsquo;ve started eating a
ketogenic diet successfully. No carbs for a month now (almost).</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done. What&rsquo;s up next then? Well, I&rsquo;ve started to read
<em>Konsten att få Metala Superkrafter</em>, which is a selfhelp book that supposedly
should help you boost memory, reading speed, creativity, etc. I&rsquo;m slightly
skeptical, but I know that the author is legit, and since all of the skills that
will supposedly be boosted are good things for a PhD student to boost, I thought
I might as well give it a go. I also hope to finish the German course on
Duolingo until the end of February. To do that I need to finish roughly 3
lessons a day for the whole month. I&rsquo;ll do my best, but it might be a bit much;
I tend to get frustrated with Duolingo because of it&rsquo;s poor design. Finally, I
plan to fix the home network quite soon. I only need to buy some equipment.</p>

<p>Finally, are there any new points to the list? Of course there are! Firstly,
<em>Subnautica</em> is added to the list of games I want to finish (which shouldn&rsquo;t be
too hard to pull off, considering that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m playing right now). Secondly
I&rsquo;m adding <em>Bioshock - Rapture</em> to the list of fiction I want to read, simply
because I loved the Bioshock games and want to experience more of what Rapture
has to offer. Other than that, nothing springs to mind at the moment. So that
leaves us with the list below. And with that, I am going to finish this post.</p>

    <updated>2018-01-03T19:45:38+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/01/03/bucket-list-of-2018</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new year has started, and as such it&rsquo;s time to once again summarize the past
year and make grand new year&rsquo;s resolutions that you won&rsquo;t keep yourself
accountable for. However, this year I decided that I&rsquo;d do something slightly
more concrete than just telling myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be healthy and get swole&rdquo;. So
I went ahead and made a bucket list, consisting of things that I want to get
done in the year to come. My plan is to revisit and revise it each month,
adding new things as they pop up and crossing out things that I have done.
However, I am not going to remove anything unless I can justify it with a very
good reason (like sickness for training goals, for instace). But first, let&rsquo;s
very quickly revisit last year.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/31/new-year-higher-resolution/">my post last year</a>
I vowed to read more books. Specifically, I wanted to read one book a month. I
also wanted to eat no excessive sugar for 100 days, and start running once a
week. I didn&rsquo;t do the last two things. Like at all. I think I went out running
a few times, but then I stopped. I forgot about the sugar thing about as soon
as I&rsquo;d posted about it. Oops. The reading, on the other hand, went quite well.
I&rsquo;ve read <em>A Cloclwork Orange</em>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/01/14/review-learn-you-a-haskell/"><em>Learn you a Haskell for Great Good</em></a>,
<em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/11/my-thoughts-on-gray-hat-hacking/"><em>Grey Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</em></a>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/20/book-review-ansible-from-beginner-to-pro/"><em>Ansible: From Beginner to Pro</em></a>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/30/book-review-exploding-the-phone-by-phil-lapsley/"><em>Exploding the Phone</em></a>,
and <em>The Hellbound Heart</em>. It&rsquo;s not the twelve books I wanted to read, but it
is seven, which is seven more than I read the year before that. Frankly, I am
quite satisfied with this.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s the bucketlist for 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li>Books

<ul>
<li>Fiction

<ul>
<li>The Graveyard Book</li>
<li>Dune</li>
<li>Tinker Tailor Solider Spy</li>
<li>House of Leaves</li>
<li>The King in Yellow</li>
<li>1984</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-fiction

<ul>
<li>Introduction to Algorithms</li>
<li>Violent Python</li>
<li>Art of Intrusion</li>
<li>Art of Deception</li>
<li>Web Application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</li>
<li>Practical Malware Analysis</li>
<li>Get Started in German</li>
<li>Konsten att få Metala Superkrafter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Movies

<ul>
<li>Dune</li>
<li>Brazil</li>
<li>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</li>
<li>Django Unchained</li>
<li>The Hateful Eight</li>
<li>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny</li>
<li>Soylent Green</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Games

<ul>
<li>Mario Odyssey</li>
<li>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
<li>DOOM</li>
<li>Cuphead</li>
<li>Dishonored 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work

<ul>
<li>Nail Advanced Algorithms</li>
<li>Two publications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health and fitness

<ul>
<li>Start working out</li>
<li>Try Aikido</li>
<li>Start eating Keto</li>
<li>Quit nailbiting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other

<ul>
<li>Start practicing violin/viola regularly</li>
<li>Fix home network</li>
<li>Fix battlestation</li>
<li>Git gud at hacking</li>
<li>Finish German course on Duolingo</li>
<li>Finish <em>Get Started in German</em></li>
<li>Get more into tea and coffee</li>
<li>Start posting here regularly, preferably about sciency stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There it is! The huge list of stuff I want to get done this year. My goals for
the coming month is to finish reading <em>The Graveyard Book</em>, because I&rsquo;m halfway
through it, and to finish playing <em>Mario Odyssey</em> for the same reason. We have
started eating keto already, but I&rsquo;m not ticking that off until it&rsquo;s clear that
we&rsquo;re sticking to it. I&rsquo;m also going to try Aikido, hopefully.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with my quest to become a better human
anymore, and move on to actually <em>being</em> one. In about three weeks, this list
will be revisited and revised!</p>

<p>Until then,<br/>
Happy Hacking!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/08/13/teaspresso/"/>
    <updated>2017-08-13T16:21:07+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/08/13/teaspresso</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am an avid coffee drinker. I love a strong cup of joe any time of day, and I
really enjoy making espressos, cappuccinos, lattes, etc. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to
see a coffee post on here some time in the future. This post, however, is not
about coffee,but it started out as a discussion about coffee on Discord.</p>

<p>We talked about how coffee is an important part of the day, when a friend on
the server said that they&rsquo;re sensitive to coffee and have to drink decaf,
which is hard to come by if you want quality goods. After stating that tea is
probably the closest you can get to coffee without it being coffee, we came to
the conclusion that coffee and tea are basically the same thing; coffee is just
&ldquo;coffee bean tea&rdquo;. This statement sparked an idea; if coffee is just tea,
does that mean that we can use tea in the same way as we use coffee? For
instance, can we make espresso using tea? Obviously it&rsquo;s possible to put tea in
an espresso machine, but how does it turn out? I felt that I had to try, so
that&rsquo;s what this post is about.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/grounds.jpg" title="Tea grounds" ></p>

<p>First off I needed the actual tea. I have made teaspresso on three kinds of
tea: a black tea, a green tea (with some dried fruit) and a rooibos tea.
Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t know more about the tea, because I bought them a while
back. Coffee is ground quite finely when making espresso, to help build up
pressure in the filter among other things. Because of this I ground the tea
with a mortar and pestle somewhat finely. In the image above, the green tea is
to the right, the rooibos is in the middle, and the black is to the left.
The pulled shots are in the picture below, and they&rsquo;re in the same order as in
the picture of the grounds.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/comparison.jpg" title="The three shots side by side" ></p>

<p>First out is the black tea, which is being pulled in the picture to the right.
To my surprise the tea actually got quite a nice crema. Not in the same way as a
good cup of espresso of course, but there was still a crema on the shot.
<img class="right" src="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/black.jpg" width="200" title="Black shot being pulled" >
The tea itself didn&rsquo;t smell a lot (disclaimer: my sense of smell is somewhat
reduced, so I might be wrong about this), but it smelled of black tea. The
texture of the teaspresso was quite silky, almost in the same way an espresso
is. It tasted pleasantly tea-y, with all the sweet notes and none of the bitter
notes. It was also somewhat tart with a citrus feeling to it. It did not taste
a lot. As an espresso tastes like a really strong cup of coffee (well, not
quite, but you get the picture) I expected the same from the tea, but I was
wrong. If I would&rsquo;ve brewed the tea normally and steeped it for say 5-6
minutes it would likely have tasted more than this did. The teaspresso did
taste somewhat differently though. In a pleasant way.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/rooibos.jpg" width="200" title="Rooibos shot being pulled" >
I moved on to the rooibos. Same procedure as last time. The color of is shot
was amazing, especially while pulling it. A lovely orange hue. The color did
tone down a bit once the teaspresso settled, but it was still quite a livid
color. Taste wise, this was a completely different beast than the black tea.
Firstly, this smelled of rooibos tea <em>a lot</em>. Secondly, this tea really packed
a punch. It didn&rsquo;t taste tea very much, but was instead intensely peppery.
It was almost like biting black pepper, but not quite as strong. The texture
wasn&rsquo;t as silky as the black teaspresso, and it had an aftertaste that I could
not quite identify. A very different experience, but not an unpleasant one.
Maybe not something anyone would like, but I sure did.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/green.jpg" width="200" title="Green shot being pulled" >
Finally there&rsquo;s the green tea. It had almost no smell (again, I&rsquo;m not the best
judge of this), but it had much taste. Unfortunately, it was not a good taste.
The green teaspresso was incredibly bitter, and left a very dry feeling in my
mouth. It did have some sweetness hiding behind the bitterness which came
forward if you sipped it in very small amounts. A friend on the Discord-channel
tried as well and didn&rsquo;t feel it though. Since he didn&rsquo;t have any dried fruit
in his tea, the dried fruit in mine might&rsquo;ve been what added the sweetness to
my shot. All in all this was not good at all, and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>

<p>Conclusions then. I think this was an exciting experiment, and I&rsquo;d like to try
this with other kinds of tea as well (yerba mate and white tea are next)
on the list. We discussed the failure of the green tea on Discord, and
theorized that the increased surface area of the ground tea might very well
mean that more tannines are released into the water, making it bitter. I&rsquo;m
therefore considering pulling another shot of the green teaspresso without
grinding the leaves and see if that turns out better.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this, I sure did! You might expect to see more stuff like
this, both on tea, coffee and perhaps the occasional cocktail. Only time will
tell. Until next time!</p>

<p>Happy (tea) Hacking</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/30/book-review-exploding-the-phone-by-phil-lapsley/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.groveatlantic.com/bigcovers/9780802120618.jpg" width="150" height="250" title="Cover" >
There we are. I have finally managed to make it through Phil Lapsely&rsquo;s book
<a href="http://explodingthephone.com/"><em>Exploding the Phone</em></a>. Despite taking me 2.5
years to get through (because I&rsquo;ve put it away for months at a time several
times, and started over reading it an equal amount of times) I did enjoy
reading it. The book, which is some 330 pages long, covers the adventures of
the <em>phone phreaks</em>, i.e. the individuals who used their wits out outsmart the
telephone system back in the day (50-70s). They were the telephone system&rsquo;s
equivalent to today&rsquo;s computer hackers, and to a large extent they set the
stage for the computer hackers themselves.</p>

<p>The book starts off way back in the late 1800s when when the Bell Telephone
Company was created, to it&rsquo;s demise in 1983. Most of the events in the book
happened in the 50-70s, however. The book lets us follow the advent and
evolution of phreaking, and get to know big names in the game such as Bill
Acker, Joe Engerssia and John Draper. Their adventures were quite awesome, in
the old sense of the word. If you want to know about what the things they
actually did you&rsquo;ll have to pick up the book; I am not going to spoil it here.</p>

<p>I would assume that most people who pick this book up are somewhat like me:
interested in technical things and probably security to some extent too. In
such case, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d be interested in how things actually worked. What
were the vulnerabilities that enabled the phreaking, and why did they work?
These are things made me want the book, and after reading it I am by no means
disappointed. The book is filled with enough technical detail that it&rsquo;s easy
to understand how and why the attacks worked, but it&rsquo;s not enough to push the
story about the phreaks out of the way. All in all, I think that it gives the
right amount of coverage.</p>

<p>Despite having a lot of technical information, the book is quite easy to read.
The language isn&rsquo;t too advanced, and everything is clearly explained. It is,
however, a bit messy chronologically. Because it follows a lot of stories
revolving around a lot of people, it isn&rsquo;t written in an entirely chronological
order. On the grand scale of things it is, but it&rsquo;s not uncommon that the
author goes on a lengthy tangent in the middle of a story. It&rsquo;s not done
needlessly or poorly, as the transitions feel natural and the tangents provide
information that&rsquo;s necessary to understand what is going on. However, it does
mess up the time line a bit, so keeping track of who lives where and who did
what in which order is a bit tricky. It doesn&rsquo;t take away much from the
experience though.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the verdict? It&rsquo;s clearly positive, I would highly recommend reading
the book. It&rsquo;s interesting and gives a lot of insight into the history of
today&rsquo;s hacker culture. Despite it taking me 2.5 years to get through the book,
I don&rsquo;t think it took too many hours to read once I actually sat down with it.
For me, it was a very worthwhile read and I&rsquo;d happily read more books like
it.</p>

<p>That concludes my review, and with that I&rsquo;m up to 6 books read this year. That
means that I&rsquo;m just one month behind where I should be, according to my new
year&rsquo;s resolution of reading one book a month. I best get to it then, so until
next time</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <updated>2017-07-20T01:41:33+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/20/book-review-ansible-from-beginner-to-pro</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time for another book review. This time of Michael Heap&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484216606">Ansible: From Beginner to Pro</a>,
published by <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a>. The 200 page book is, as the
name suggests, about the orchestration tool Ansible. It&rsquo;s a tool that I don&rsquo;t
have any previous experience of, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying it out in
the real world! Now, let&rsquo;s jump into it!</p>

<p>For being such a short book it covers quite a few topics. It assumes no
previous knowledge, and starts from the very beginning. It then walks through
the various components of Ansible projects, like inventory files (files
containing lists of hosts to run Ansible against), roles and how to write your
own modules with Python. The explanations are clear, and throughout the book a
running example (consisting of a WordPress installation) is used to demonstrate
the different topics. The nice tone and spacious layout also contributes to make
reading the book a pleasant experience, and I managed to read the full thing
cover to cover in about a weekend without trying too hard.</p>

<p>So, are there anything that&rsquo;s not that great about the book? Well, I had issues
with a few steps along the way, and while I did manage to solve I would&rsquo;ve
liked some form of guidance from the book. It doesn&rsquo;t cover troubleshooting at
all, which come to think of it none of the other books I&rsquo;ve reviewed have
either (I particularly remember trying desperately to understand the Haskell
error messages I got when reading <em>Learn you a Haskell</em>, which are all quite
cryptic). It was a while since I read the book, so I don&rsquo;t remember specifically
what the issues where, but I do remember that for a beginner like myself the
solution wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious. Apart from this I have no big issues with
the book. I enjoyed both it and the tool quite a bit, and I hope the other
books from Apress have the same standard (I have a few in my backlog).</p>

<p>Now, on to the big question: Am I an Ansible pro now? After all, that&rsquo;s
what the book&rsquo;s name suggests I should be. To be fair, I think that <em>pro</em>
might be a slight exaggeration. While I think that I could probably orchestrate
a server reasonably well using Ansible at this point, there&rsquo;s still a lot to
learn. The book mentions some best practices for various parts of the tool, but
my experience from other areas tell me that while I may understand these, it&rsquo;ll
take a bit of active use of the tool before they&rsquo;re fully internalized. That
being said, I do believe that I know enough to orchestrate a server. And I will
    soon know for sure; I bought a VPS recently and I plan to orchestrate it using
Ansible, both for simplicity and for practice. This will happen sometime during
the coming week, so I&rsquo;ll get back to you then. I also have some neat ideas
regarding orchestrating localhost that I want to try out, so and I&rsquo;ll let you
read all about it once I&rsquo;ve given it a go.</p>

<p>To conclude, would I recommend this book? If you&rsquo;re a sysadmin on any level,
be it on a hobby level like me or a professional level like not me, yes. It&rsquo;s
a tool that makes the setting up of a server a lot easier, and the fact that
you can dry-run your playbooks in a virtual environment without any fuzz is
great. If you&rsquo;re not a sysadmin I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it though. It&rsquo;s a pleasant
read nonetheless, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get much out of it. Unless, of
course, my little experiment works. Then you might want to have a look at it
for ricing reasons. We&rsquo;ll see I guess. Until then!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, here we are agian. Yet another change of blogging platform. This one is
here to stay, at least of a while. I promise.</p>

<p>So why do I change once again? Well, the reason is simple: time. I have a lot
of things I <em>want</em> to add to my old blog, like commenting and possibly RSS and
stuff, but I don&rsquo;t really have the time. So I went looking for a suitable
platform, and found this. Like my old blog this renders Markdown, but it also
does syntax highlighting and stuff more efficiently than my old blog. So this
is what I&rsquo;ll go with.</p>

<p>Am I going to abandon my old blog then? No, not quite. I don&rsquo;t plan on using
it as my blogging platform anytime in the near future, but I do plan to keep it
alive and well inside a VM and keep developing it. So maybe I&rsquo;ll use it again
in the future, who knows? But for now it&rsquo;s only going to be a side project, the
progress of which I&rsquo;ll share here.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;m going to migrate all the old posts to this
platform, but it might take a bit of time because of formatting differences
and stuff. Until next time!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/11/my-thoughts-on-gray-hat-hacking/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/11/my-thoughts-on-gray-hat-hacking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here we are again, I&rsquo;ve actually read another book. That makes four this year,
out of which three have been on some form of computer related topic. So my
New Year&rsquo;s resolution to read twelve books this year is actually looking like
it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

<p>But enough beating around be bush, if you&rsquo;re reading this it&rsquo;s because you want
to know what I think of <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ace/media/gray-hat-hacking.pdf">Gray Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</a>,
so here&rsquo;s what I think of it: I&rsquo;m not sure. I think that I may be a poor judge,
because I was expecting more than I got. See, this book is quite praised in
hacker circles, at least as I remember it from the days when I used to hang out
in hacker forums. It is one of <em>the</em> books you should read if you want to get
into the world of hacking. So knowing this I obviously expected miracles, more
or less, when I started reading. Unfortunately, that is not what <em>I</em> got.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I want to point out a few things. Firstly, I have not
read this cover to cover. I&rsquo;ve read the better part of it, but I&rsquo;ve skipped
quite some text that I didn&rsquo;t have a need for right now. This mostly involves
fluff like how to use specific tools, what it means to be an <em>Ethical Hacker</em>.
Secondly, since I have an education in computer security where I have actually
had this book as course literature (I didn&rsquo;t read it at the time though), I knew
a lot of these things before. This is part of the reason why I didn&rsquo;t get the
miracle I was expecting. With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get into the meat of'er!</p>

<p>The book quite hefty at 672 pages. It covers <em>a lot</em> of topics, ranging from how
to report found vulnerabilities to basic programming (I&rsquo;m coming back to this
later) to quite advanced tricks to get around protection schemes. This is why I
believe that it&rsquo;s considered such a good book to read if you want to enter the
world of hacking; it does give an introduction to a great many things. However,
some of these fields are covered so briefly that they might as well have left
them out. This includes SQL and XSS injections, that are only really touched
upon. Other topics, buffer overflows in particular, are elaborated on. The
explanations of these topics are well composed, with working(ish) examples,
complete with code, explanations and references. This allow you to follow along
for the most part, which is great! As opposed to Black Hat Python, where the
code examples comes first and the explanation afterwards, here the explanation
of the vulnerability comes first and the exploit is then iteratively
constructed, showing all steps along the way. The only real problem I have with
this is that their type setting for the code segment is quite bad, and sometimes
separate lines are printed on the same line. This is really a minor complaint
though.</p>

<p>One thing that is not the books fault, but decreases the value of it none the
less, is that it is a book and it&rsquo;s written in 2011. This means that some of the
things brought up in it is no longer possible, or no longer relevant. For
instance, the book walked throught the process of injecting shellcode via the
<code>.dtors</code> section of a program (I&rsquo;m not explaining that further, not in this
post at least). That section is replaces with <code>.fini_array</code> since GCC 4.7, which
works differently and makes the covered attack impossible. There&rsquo;s likely a
similar attack that exploits the new format, but for obvious reasons the book
doesn&rsquo;t cover it. There are a number of such instances, but as mentioned it&rsquo;s
not the fault of the authors but rather the ever-changing nature of the field.</p>

<p>Another thing that I find strange about the book is it&rsquo;s pacing. It&rsquo;s covering
fairly advanced attacks and how to construct your own shellcode, while at the
same time covering basic programming. This section is really quite short and as
I&rsquo;m quite adept at programming I only skimmed it, but I could see that it was on
the level of &ldquo;every C program needs a function called <code>main()</code>&rdquo;. In other words,
that part of the text was aimed at someone who has never seen a line of code.
This is odd to me, as security is no basic topic. Sure, there are a ton of
script kiddies who run around on the interwebs thinking they&rsquo;re 1337 hax0rz
because the figured out how to download LOIC (or whatever is the latest and
greatest DDoS tool now-a-days), but this is a book that aims to educate security
professionals. Demanding a certain amount of previous knowledge of how C,
memory and such works would not be too much to ask in my opinion. Especially
when, as I said, shellcode construction is covered. This involves writing
(short) C programs that do what you want, compiling them and removing any
unnecessary ASM that the compiler added, only to then assemble and extract the
opcodes. In other words, it&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;d be able to do confidently if you
don&rsquo;t know C before you start reading.</p>

<p>Apart from this I like the book. I didn&rsquo;t get much out of it, but that is
because I already knew most of it. The parts I didn&rsquo;t know where quite
interesting to read about, and as I said it covers the topics well. Because of
this I&rsquo;d agree with the statement that this is one of <em>the books</em> to read if you
want to get going with <em>ethical</em> hacking. Do yourself a favour and wait until
you&rsquo;re at least somewhat proficient in C and x86 assembler before you pick up
the book though, as you might have a hard time understanding some of the
examples otherwise.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, I hope you enjoyed this.. reviewish. Until next time,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Initial Impressions: Black Hat Python]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/10/initial-impressions-bhp/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/10/initial-impressions-bhp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I dug my teeth into a new piece of literature:
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython">Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters</a>
by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent more then
five minutes on this site probably knows that No Starch is my favorite publisher
and that I think they usually publish books of high quality. Spoiler alert; this
book does not fall in that category.</p>

<p>Before I go on, I want to give a short disclaimer though. This is by no means a
<em>book review</em>. I have not read the whole thing cover to cover (yet), I have just
read the first few chapters and put it away because I really disliked the way
the author&rsquo;s style of teaching. I plan on reading the full thing at some point
and give a <em>proper</em> review, but I want to give some kind of a heads up for
anyone reading. So, let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

<p>First off, I was quite excited to read this. I enjoy working with Python, and
would say that it&rsquo;s probably the language I use the most. I&rsquo;m also quite
interested in computer security, and one of my previous goals was to become a
professional pentester. So obviously this book was quite appealing. The book is
written by Justin Seitz, who at the time of writing writing the book worked at
Immunity Inc with security analysis. He&rsquo;s also written another book for No
Starch Press called <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/ghpython.htm">Gray Hat Python</a>
(which I&rsquo;ll get arount to reading Soon™), so it all seems good! The book covers
a range of topics, from how to set up the testing environment to how to automate
forenic tasks, spread trojans via github, and playing around with the network.
From just looking at it from the outside, it looks like a really nice book (it
has a nice cover too!)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as the saying goes, you should not judge a book by it&rsquo;s cover.
While the text itself holds up to the quality of the other No Starch books I&rsquo;ve
read, the actual <em>content</em> of the book does not. Each section in the book
describes a problem, like needing a quick way to send commands to a compromised
server. The text then guides you through a solution to the problem, and this is
where the problems start. Firstly, the solution is presented <em>before</em> the
explanation of even the steps to take. This might seem like a small issue, and
maybe it is for some, but I prefer to give it a go myself first, <em>before</em> I look
at a solution. I know this might be hard with books like this, but just listing
what the solution must do isn&rsquo;t too much to ask, is it? The second thing that
bugged me, which is what made me put the book away, is the actual explanations
themselves. They are really short, and don&rsquo;t explain much at all. To showcase
this, let&rsquo;s have a look at the following example:</p>

<p>A simple enough python class, that is used to build an SSH-server to send
commands through to the client, which is uploaded to the victim. The
explanation for the code is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>just like we did earlier in the chapter, and then SSHinize it</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not the first thing the book covered on SSH using the Paramiko library,
but a class was never used. Also, none of the Paramiko flags were used earlier.
But their names are good, so it&rsquo;s easy enough to understand the function of the
Server-class anyway. Now, let&rsquo;s skip forward in the code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>None of this has been used before, but it&rsquo;s all pretty obvious; set <code>client</code> (
which is an already connected socket) as the socket on which to transport the
SSH session, add a keyfile, build a server-object and use that as the server.
The explanation for this is</p>

<blockquote><p>configure the authentication methods</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, what? I guess this is technically correct, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain
<em>anything</em>. Sure, it&rsquo;s not that hard to understand, but still. The thing that
really annoys me is this: <code>bhSession.start_server(server=server)</code>. <code>bhSession</code>
is a paramiko-object of some kind, and to that objects member function
<code>start_server()</code> we pass our homebrewed Server-class. This means that, since
it will be used by a function in a library, the Server-class have to have some
functions and variables that should respond to different things. These are quite
important pieces of information if you want to build something yourself rather
than just copy and paste from a book. Alas, if I want to learn that I have to
consult the Paramiko documentation, because there isn&rsquo;t an explanation within
sight in the book.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind reading documentation, but I do mind paying $34 for a book
that supposedly should teach me something, only to be forced to read open
documentation if I want more understanding than copying, pasting and running can
give. Fortunately I got the book in a HumbleBundle, so I hardly payed for it.
And maybe it gets better later in the book, but right now I don&rsquo;t have time to
find out. As I said, this is very much a first imporession of the book and I
will get back to it. I just really think it&rsquo;s a shame that they didn&rsquo;t make it
twice as long (it&rsquo;s just short of 165 pages) and elaborated on the explanations
more, so that you don&rsquo;t need to consult the documentation to understand what&rsquo;s
going on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for my rant on this book. I&rsquo;ll revisit it Sometime™ and write a real
review. But for now this will have to do. I&rsquo;ll have a review on another book I
recently read shortly, but until then</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <updated>2017-01-14T23:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/01/14/review-learn-you-a-haskell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but now I am finally done reading
<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, so it is
time for me not only to get coding, but also to review the book!</p>

<p>Haskell is a language that I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing for quite some time, but I have
hesitated to get started with it due to it being a functional programming
language. As a guy coming from a mainly imperative background (I do most work
in C or Python), this is quite different and without a good tutorial it seemed
quite inaccessible. Luckily for me, Learn You a Haskell showed up on
<a href="https://humblebundle.com">HumbleBundle</a> a while ago, so I took the opportunity
to buy it.</p>

<p>The book is aimed at people like me: people experienced in programming, but new
to functional programming. The book guides the reader though the core concepts
of Haskell in a conversational tone that is riddled with examples. The language
is easy to follow, and new concepts are described clearly. The powerfulness of
the language is shown both through descriptions in the text, but also with the
examples. In general I would say that it&rsquo;s a really good book that is very
worth reading.</p>

<p>However, the book has one downside; its lack of exercises. As mentioned, it is
full of examples, and they do great job at showing how things work and how
powerful the language is when used correctly. Unfortunately there are no clear
exercises. Some of the examples are extended through description, where the
actual implementation of the extension is left as an exercise to the reader,
but as someone who want to learn how to work with the language and have never
done anything functional before it is hard to come up with exercises for
yourself. I really do think that the book would benefit a lot from having
explicit tasks to do yourself at the end of each chapter. As it is now, I am
quite confident that I understand the concepts of the language after reading
the book, but I am far from confident with coding in it. Of course I would not
have become a Haskell wizard by reading the book even if it did have exercises,
but I think I would&rsquo;ve been closer.</p>

<p>Regardless I think that it is a really good book, and a really good
introduction to both Haskell and functional programming, and I am looking
forward to getting to know Haskell in a more practical way. As a final note
I&rsquo;d like to recommend it if you&rsquo;re interested in learning Haskell. There are a
lot of very large and crooked questionmarks surrounding the world of functional
programming if you&rsquo;re from an imperative or object oriented background, but the
book does a great job of straightening those into exclamation marks.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to delve into the next book, which will be
<a href="http://users.metu.edu.tr/serge/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf">How to Prove it</a>,
a review of that will come when I&rsquo;m done working through it.</p>

<p>Until the next time,</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/31/new-year-higher-resolution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a new year, which means that it&rsquo;s time to make new year&rsquo;s resolutions that
you&rsquo;re not going to keep. Or maybe you will! I for one will really try to keep
mine, because I really want to make myself a better person. So what are my
new year&rsquo;s resolutions going to be?</p>

<p>First off, and I know that I&rsquo;ve said this a few times before, I am going to
read more. For reals this time. Thing is that I have a ton of books, both
fictional and factual, that I&rsquo;ve been eager to read. However, I have a severe
case of &ldquo;積ん読&rdquo; or <em>tsundoku</em>. It&rsquo;s a Japanese word for &ldquo;buying books
but not reading them&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku">seriously</a>).
Now I want to stop having this.. &ldquo;condition&rdquo;, I want to start reading. Not only
because books are expensive and I should not spend money unnecessarily, but
also because what I do when I don&rsquo;t read is quite stupid. Usually, I just
imgur or reddit, or play some game. Sure, gaming is good for relaxing, but so
is learning new things. So, my plan is to spend less time browsing reddit and
more time reading things. So, new year&rsquo;s resolution number one is that I shall
read one book a month.</p>

<p>The second one is something I am going to do together with my girlfriend. We&rsquo;re
going to not consume any unnecessary sugar for 100 days. This means no candy,
soda, alcohol, cookies or anything else like that for one hundred days, i.e.
until April 9th. We&rsquo;re not going to over do it, so sugar in food products is
OK.</p>

<p>Lastly there&rsquo;s the obligatory &ldquo;get in shape&rdquo; resolution. I have these fancy
(but ugly) Vibram Fivefinger shoes that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been using too little. So I&rsquo;m
going to take up running again, at least once a week. Also I&rsquo;m going to try to
start lifting weights down at the gym. I&rsquo;m doing this not only to become a
Greek god (which I obviously will become), but also to relieve some stress.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s my three new year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading one book a month, be it fictional or educational</li>
<li>No excess sugar for 100 days</li>
<li>Start running at least once a week</li>
</ul>


<p>So that&rsquo;s it for this post. Sorry for deluding you into thinking I was getting
a 4k monitor or something that cool for the new year. Hopefully I will update
my rig during the year, and I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on that, but for now this is
all.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <updated>2016-12-18T23:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/18/getting-classy-with-haskell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I thought that the next post I was going to do would be one on higher order
functions. In fact, I started writing one a couple of times, but it just didn&rsquo;t
seem necessary. Why was that? Well, it all actually made sense. I had a read
through the chapter, and the theory wan&rsquo;t that hard. Once I had also
reimplemented the fold and scan functions recusively myself I felt that I had
a quite solid grip on higher order functions. And man, are they powerful!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve moved forward, past modules and into the end of defining my own
data types. While that is itself quite straight forward, there are quite
a few things that aren&rsquo;t exactly odd, but they need to be remebered, so I&rsquo;m
jotting it down here.</p>

<p>To star off, if you want to define a new data type you use the <code>data</code> keyword.
It looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Green</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a data type called <code>TrafficLight</code>, of which we can create the
values <code>Red</code>, <code>Yellow</code> and <code>Green</code> using it&rsquo;s <em>value constructors</em>. While this
is a perfectly fine class, we can&rsquo;t print it to the terminal, read it from a
string, order it or check if it&rsquo;s values are equal at present. To fix that we
could do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Read</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Ord</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This allow us to do everything stated above. The <code>Eq</code> type class (we&rsquo;ll get to
that later) allow us to equate elements. The default behaviour is that
<code>Red == Red</code> is true, while <code>Red == Green</code> is false. The <code>Ord</code> allow us to
order the values. The default behaviour for this type class is that the value
constructors <em>to the left</em> are <strong>smaller</strong> than the ones on the right. I.e., in
this example <code>Red &lt; Green</code> is true while <code>Yellow &gt; Green</code> is false, because of
the order they&rsquo;re defined in the type definition.</p>

<p>It is also possible to define a new data type using a class constructor. This
is something that&rsquo;s been used in the type definitions of functions through out
the book, and isn&rsquo;t that strange really. For instance, a simple binary search
tree could be implemented like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Ord</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using this kind of declaration, it is possible to store any data type in the
tree, as long as it is orderable and equatable. Which makes sense, since it&rsquo;s a
BST.</p>

<p>We can also use the register syntax to add some additional context to our data
type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Person</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">firstname</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lastname</span>  <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">birthyear</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All this is quite straight forward, if a bit much to take in all at once. But
it quite makes sense anyway. Now, let&rsquo;s get into the really strange things.
Let&rsquo;s start off with instances.</p>

<p>Earlier I showed that in order to make the value constructors of a class
equatable (is that even a word? Sounds weird) you need to derive the <code>Eq</code> type
class in your data type. This imposes some default behaviour, as described. If
you for some reason aren&rsquo;t happy with this default behaviour you can go around
it by making your type an <em>instance</em> of <code>Eq</code>, like this (I&rsquo;m using the
TrafficLight type for this example):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This basically says that <code>Red == Red</code> is true, and so is <code>Yellow == Yellow</code> and
<code>Green == Green</code>. All other combinations, however, are false. This overrides
how <code>Eq</code> typically behaves (and in this case, replaces the behaviour with an
identical behaviour). I can really see how this is useful, as it bares some
resemblance to defining your own equality operator (or the like; this works for
any type class) in C++.</p>

<p>Next up is actual type classes, and inheritance from those. Coming from a (sort
of) object oriented (I bloody hate object oriented programming..) background,
this seems quite strange. A class in Haskell isn&rsquo;t like a class in C++; a bunch
of functions and variables crammed together into one name. In Haskel, it&rsquo;s just
a collection of type definitions for functions. In other words, it&rsquo;s kind of
like a C++ class with no variables and only virtual functions. If you have a
class that itself is a type constructor, then you can make the class a subclass
of another class. For instance, the <code>Ord</code> class is a subclass of <code>Eq</code>,
because it makes sense that any data types that are orderable are also
equatable.</p>

<p>As a grand finale of this monstrosity of a post, we have functors. Oh dear, how
weird functors seemed at first. A type class that is meant for things that can
be mapped. It sounded so strange at first, but once I realized how it could
be utilized for any data type that can either be empty, or contain something,
it was quite obvious how awesome this was. For instance, the <code>Tree</code> I
defined earlier has the following definition:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">derives</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, say I want to write a function that traverses all of the tree and applies
an arbitrary function to the values of each node. Using functors it&rsquo;s as easy
as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="kt">Functor</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! I tell Haskell that I want to make the Tree type an instance of the
Functor class, I define how I want the <code>fmap</code> function to act on the tree and
as a result I can now multiply all node values of a tree of integers like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">fmap</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">tree</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It goes over the tree and builds a new tree. Writing this I realize that doing
this with a normal function would actually work the exact same way, but I am
sure that functors have some advantage over normal functions that I just don&rsquo;t
see with my inexperienced eyes.</p>

<p>So, after a long read (both for me and you) we&rsquo;re finally at the end of this
post (and the chapters on types and classes in &ldquo;Learn you a Haskell&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s
been quite the journey, and it has taken me a couple of days to get here, which
makes sense considering I&rsquo;ve had to forget everything I know about classes. But
Haskell&rsquo;s type system seems really cool, and I look forward to getting to know
it better! But now I&rsquo;ll take a break. Until next time,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

What I&rsquo;ve done is a home screen for your browser that at least I think is

print a nifty, randomized title on the page, as well as dynamically build links

<p>If you think this looks nice and want to try it out, all instructions you

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here we are again, another post about Haskell. To star off I just want to say
that I am having a blast learning this, and that I think I am getting the
hang of it. I&rsquo;ve gone through recursion today, which isn&rsquo;t really a new concept
to me, but it&rsquo;s tricky to know what to do in a completely new language.
However, I managed to write all example function from the book on my own, which
I think is a sign that I am starting to get this. For instance, I came up with
this solution to writing quicksort:</p>

<p>The definition in the book was:</p>

<p>So the only real differences is that I have one unnecessary case in my pattern
matching (<code>quicksort [x] = [x]</code>) and that I use <code>where</code> instead of <code>let</code>. I&rsquo;m
quite satisfied with that!</p>

<p>The next chapter is on currying, folds and other strange things. From what I
remember, these things all appeared very odd to me, so I think I&rsquo;ll take that
tomorrow instead. So I guess I didn&rsquo;t really learn that much today, but it&rsquo;s
nice to see that I am getting closer to understanding this language.</p>

<p>Anyway, expect a monster update when I&rsquo;m done with the next chapter, because
there&rsquo;ll be a lot to anchor in my mind by writing about it. Until then,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <updated>2016-12-10T23:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/10/more-haskell-peculiarities</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My mission to learn Haskell goes on, and I&rsquo;ve now  read about functions. As
Haskell is a purley functional language, it makes sense that functions are
quite important and well developed in the language. There are a lot of things
I really like with the way Haskell does functions that are strange in the eyes
of an imperative programmer, and I&rsquo;m going to jot some of it down here to try
to reinforce my own understanding of it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <em>guards</em>. In Haskell, a guard is basically a large if-else
statement. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">function</span> <span class="n">var</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">statement</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">statement</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For instance, if I want to build a function that returns <code>True</code> if the input is
even I could write it like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span><span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Integral</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This makes for code that is quite easy to read, especially when there are a lot
of different cases to match against. Speaking of cases, there are of course
switch-case statements in Haskell too, but just like if-statements they aren&rsquo;t
statements but expressions. That means that the following is valid in Haskell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">length&#39;</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;The list is &quot;</span> <span class="o">++</span> <span class="kr">case</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="kt">[]</span>    <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;empty</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">                                          [x]   -&gt; &quot;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">singleton</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">                                          (x:_) -&gt; &quot;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">long</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another thing that I really like is the <code>where</code> binding. It allows you to bind
an expression to a name in the scope of a function. That means that the <code>even</code>
function from earlier could be rewritten like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span><span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Integral</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="kr">where</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the <code>let</code> expression. In my opinion (this may well change as I
get to know the language better) it seems to be most usable in list
comprehensions, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">double</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="ow">&lt;-</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="kr">let</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learnt today. Writing this I got some of the syntax
wrong, but that&rsquo;s to expect when I&rsquo;ve just started out. I think I grasp the
concepts though, so that&rsquo;s really nice. Next up is recursion, which should be
a blast. But now I&rsquo;m going to sleep.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <updated>2016-12-09T23:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/09/learning-me-a-haskell-for-great-good</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was informed roughly what I will be doing at work next semester (when I
say &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; I mean that the suggested work load probably is way through the
roof, and that it will need to be adjusted before the term starts), and one
of the things I&rsquo;ll be spending my time on is research. Since I am just a
project assistant and not a PhD student my research will be quite limited by
time (I will only spend 80 hours on it over the entire semester), but it&rsquo;s
something.</p>

<p>What my supervisor want me to do is have a look at a parsing library for
Haskell called <a href="https://github.com/aslatter/parsec">Parsec</a>. There&rsquo;s only one
problem; I don&rsquo;t know Haskell. Yet. So, today I set out on my journey to learn
my first functional programming language, and I thought I&rsquo;d let you in on the
fun. Starting with this post, I will be posting about my progress with learning
the (to me) new language. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be getting something out of it, maybe
not. I&rsquo;m going to do it regardless.</p>

<p>So, to start off I want to mention the book I&rsquo;ll be learning from. It&rsquo;s called
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/lyah.htm">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, and is
published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. I&rsquo;ll write a review
of the book once I&rsquo;m done working though it.</p>

<p>Now, without further adue, let&rsquo;s delve into Haskell! (Note that I&rsquo;m mostly by
no means going to try to teach you Haskell, I&rsquo;m mostly just going to ramble on
about things I find weird about the language)</p>

<p>As a C and Python programmer, Haskell seems quite strange. It feel a lot like
Python in the way that it is written, but some things are strange. For
instance, the following is perfectly legitimate syntax for Haskell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">foo</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">if</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="kr">then</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="kr">else</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First of all, this is a function declaration and not a variable assingment. But
that&rsquo;s not the main thing that&rsquo;s bugging me about this. It&rsquo;s that the <code>if</code>
itself <em>returns</em> a value, which I can then add <code>1</code> to. As the book expresses
it: there is no such thing as an <code>if</code> <em>statement</em> in Haksell, there are <code>if</code>
<em>expressions</em> instead. Very strange.</p>

<p>Another thing that is qutie odd, but does make sense, is the way list items are
accessed. Coming from imperative languages, I am used to the <code>list[index]</code>
syntax if I want to access a list element. However, that kind of syntax
wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in Haskell, since Haskell has no variables. Insted the
syntax is</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">!!</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This would fetch <code>4</code>, which is the third item of the list. To finish off, I
want to mention a thing that&rsquo;s really weird with Haskell, but it&rsquo;s something
I wish all languages did: argument pattern matching. For instance, to build a
(probably poor) summing function one could do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum&#39;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="kt">:</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">sum&#39;</span> <span class="n">xs</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum&#39;</span> <span class="kt">[]</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This basically means that the function <code>sum'</code> takes a list, and puts the first
element in it&rsquo;s own variable. It then adds that to the recursive call to the
function itself. Once the list is empty (the <code>sum' []</code>), <code>0</code> is returned. No
<code>if</code> expressions, nothing. Just matching the input with an empty list.
Bloody brilliant!</p>

<p>Anyway, this post is already way longer than it should, so I&rsquo;m going to sign
off now.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

frequently in the future, and I actually have a plan on how to do that. But
that&rsquo;s for another post. Today I want to talk about winter!</p>

<p>Winter is by far my favorite time of year; you get to drink hot cocoa, wear
cozy clothes, and you can go outside wihtout dying from the heat. It&rsquo;s the
bee&rsquo;s knees! But what would winter be without a good advent calendar?</p>

<p>I am of course talking about <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. It&rsquo;s
a great project to keep your hacker spirit alive over the holidays. Last year
I tried to follow, and I did for a few days before I lost track of it, but this
year I&rsquo;m going to finish. So far I&rsquo;ve finished all the tasks, and I have
learned a couple of things along the way (how to do multithreading i Python
for example). If you haven&rsquo;t already checked it out, you should click the
link above right now and join the fun!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all I wanted to say. If you&rsquo;re interested, all my solutions

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/08/15/linux-commandline-review/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/08/15/linux-commandline-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s finally time for me to post my first book review! As mentioned I&rsquo;ve wanted
to do this for quite some time, both to get some more posting here on the blog
done and to give me an incentive to actually read the books I buy. So here it
is, the first book review on this blog!</p>

<p>The book I&rsquo;ve (actually) read is
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/tlcl"><em>The Linux Commandline</em></a> by <strong>William E. Shotts,
Jr.</strong>, published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. The book is
aimed at people who have just installed Linux and is clueless about where to go
from there. As such I am quite a bit outside of the target audience, but despite
this I found the book to be a very good read (I mean, I finished it&hellip;).</p>

<p><em>The Linux Commandline</em> is divided into four parts: Learning the shell;
Configuration and the Environment; Common Tasks and Essential Tools; and Writing
Shell Scripts. Just looking at this it is clear that the book covers a great
many subjects in the world of the Linux commandline. As I said it is aimed at
complete Linux newbies, and as such it begins at a very basic level. In the very
first chapter the concept of a <em>shell</em> is explained, along with things such as
the fact that the shell tells you that no command was found if you try to
execute random letters. Once that is dealt with the book works it&rsquo;s way from
commands like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> to more complex commands like <code>sed</code> and how to write
regular expressions for <code>sed</code>. It covers pipes, redirection, searching with
<code>find</code> and touches on editing with my personal favorite editor Vim. When all
these topics are covered, the author shows how to glue it all together using
<code>if</code>-statements, <code>for</code>-loops and shell functions to build complete shell
scripts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the book covers a lot, but the big question is whether or not
it does it well. To that my answer is yes. As mentioned I am far from the target
audience with 10 years of working with Linux in my luggage. Despite this I
actually learned a thing or two from the book. A large part of the book could be
skimmed, such as descriptions of what <code>ls -l</code> and <code>ls -a</code> do, but some chapters
were completely new such as how to print files to paper via the CLI. Apart from
the content being very fleshed out it is also well written in a style that is
easy to read and learn from. Descriptions are clear and the vast majority of all
commands covered are also used in an example, so that it is easy for the reader
to follow along and try things out.</p>

<p>To conclude this is a book that according to me is clearly worth the $39.95. I
only own it as an e-book, but I am tempted to buy a paperback as well to have a
physical copy. It is well written, clearly describes how to efficiently work
with the shell on a basic to intermediate level, and I think that if everyone
who tried Linux would take the time to work through this their Linux experience
would be a lot better.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/08/15/had-it-with-nms/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/08/15/had-it-with-nms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As probably nobody with even the slightest interest in gaming has missed, the
hype of the year has finally come out: No Man&rsquo;s Sky. The game where there is an
infinite, procedurally generated universe to discover and explore, creatures
created not by careful design but by artifical evolution to marvel at, alien
cultures to encounter and interact with! Over at
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame">/r/NoMansSkyTheGame</a> people have
torn their hair in anticipation of this game. And I must admit, I was quite
excited about it as well. Becuase it sounds pretty cool, doesn&rsquo;t it? With all
that exploration to do, all those discoveries to be made.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve tried. I really have. I&rsquo;ve spent ten hours over the weekend trying to
get into it, but I just can&rsquo;t. The game is horrendous. I&rsquo;ve had it. It&rsquo;s not
just that there&rsquo;s nothing to do in the game, it&rsquo;s also that everything is
exactly the same and nothing makes sense! For instance I visited a quite
chilly planet, so to speak. The temperature was at -30 to -60 centrigrades.
Despite this there were liquid water! Fancy that, no ice! When I then fly over
to another planet in the same solar system I notice something interesting; the
exact same plants as I found on another planet <em>in another solar system</em> lives
there. Not something similar, the <em>exact</em> same but with a (presumably)
different name. Not to mention the creatures created by the artificial
evolution.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Britbongreturns/status/765190830894317568">This</a> post
by <a href="https://twitter.com/Britbongreturns">@Britbongreturns</a> sums it up quite
nicely, so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this post, let&rsquo;s go over a few of the selling points on the
game&rsquo;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/#app_reviews_hash">Steam page</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant
 danger and action</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well this is just a downright lie: The planets may be procedurally
generated, and therefore unique, but apparently reusing every resource
there is in the game isn&rsquo;t covered by this. Also, if there is so much
danger and action, how come I haven&rsquo;t experienced neither danger nor
action?</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading
 screens, and no limits.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is actually true! There are no loading screens! Instead there is the
most terrible texture popping I have ever seen! Not only does it pop in
textures as you&rsquo;re closing up to them, but it &ldquo;unpops&rdquo; them as well; if you
have mined out a huge pillar of e.g. gold then you&rsquo;ll still see it at a
distance! Terrible!</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a
 journey towards it</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huh, the more you know. Apart from the exposition given right here I haven&rsquo;t
been given any incentive so far for going to the center of the galaxy.
Weird.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To conclude this rant I&rsquo;d like to say that I didn&rsquo;t want a 60€ game with
horrible &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; in it. I already own a game like that: Spore! So now I&rsquo;m
done with this disappointment. I&rsquo;m going back to buying small, unknown indie
games via <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">HumbleBundle</a>, at least I usually
enjoy at least they&rsquo;re enjoyable for the most part.</p>

    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/08/10/hello_world_2.0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There we are. I have finally gotten around to rebuilding my blog. I&rsquo;ve been
mearning to do that for a couple of months, but there&rsquo;s been a lot going on
lately so I haven&rsquo;t had the time. Until now. I must say that I&rsquo;m quite
satisfied how it turned out. There are still a couple of things I want to
add to it, like a commenting feature, but I&rsquo;ll get to that Later<TM>.</p>

<p>Now, I know I&rsquo;ve been worse at posting here than a cat is at barking, but
I&rsquo;m hoping to change that because I&rsquo;ve got a lot going on! First things first,
I&rsquo;m planning to work my way though all the books I buy for decoration, I mean
never get around to reading. What&rsquo;s more is that I&rsquo;m going to review them here
too! That means that I&rsquo;ll both start reading <em>and</em> posting more! Win-win!</p>

<p>Apart from reviewing printed teachings (and the odd piece of fiction maybe)
I also have a couple of hardware projects coming up which I&rsquo;m going to share
with you guys. So hopefully there&rsquo;ll be a lot going on here on the blog in
the future!</p>

<p>Right now I have to go to sleep though, so I&rsquo;ll see you next time!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
