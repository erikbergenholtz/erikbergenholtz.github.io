<div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I dug my teeth into a new piece of literature:
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython">Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters</a>
by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent more then
five minutes on this site probably knows that No Starch is my favorite publisher
and that I think they usually publish books of high quality. Spoiler alert; this
book does not fall in that category.</p>

<p>Before I go on, I want to give a short disclaimer though. This is by no means a
<em>book review</em>. I have not read the whole thing cover to cover (yet), I have just
read the first few chapters and put it away because I really disliked the way
the author&rsquo;s style of teaching. I plan on reading the full thing at some point
and give a <em>proper</em> review, but I want to give some kind of a heads up for
anyone reading. So, let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

<p>First off, I was quite excited to read this. I enjoy working with Python, and
would say that it&rsquo;s probably the language I use the most. I&rsquo;m also quite
interested in computer security, and one of my previous goals was to become a
professional pentester. So obviously this book was quite appealing. The book is
written by Justin Seitz, who at the time of writing writing the book worked at
Immunity Inc with security analysis. He&rsquo;s also written another book for No
Starch Press called <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/ghpython.htm">Gray Hat Python</a>
(which I&rsquo;ll get arount to reading Soonâ„¢), so it all seems good! The book covers
a range of topics, from how to set up the testing environment to how to automate
forenic tasks, spread trojans via github, and playing around with the network.
From just looking at it from the outside, it looks like a really nice book (it
has a nice cover too!)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as the saying goes, you should not judge a book by it&rsquo;s cover.
While the text itself holds up to the quality of the other No Starch books I&rsquo;ve
read, the actual <em>content</em> of the book does not. Each section in the book
describes a problem, like needing a quick way to send commands to a compromised
server. The text then guides you through a solution to the problem, and this is
where the problems start. Firstly, the solution is presented <em>before</em> the
explanation of even the steps to take. This might seem like a small issue, and
maybe it is for some, but I prefer to give it a go myself first, <em>before</em> I look
at a solution. I know this might be hard with books like this, but just listing
what the solution must do isn&rsquo;t too much to ask, is it? The second thing that
bugged me, which is what made me put the book away, is the actual explanations
themselves. They are really short, and don&rsquo;t explain much at all. To showcase
this, let&rsquo;s have a look at the following example:</p>

<p>A simple enough python class, that is used to build an SSH-server to send
commands through to the client, which is uploaded to the victim. The
explanation for the code is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>just like we did earlier in the chapter, and then SSHinize it</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not the first thing the book covered on SSH using the Paramiko library,
but a class was never used. Also, none of the Paramiko flags were used earlier.
But their names are good, so it&rsquo;s easy enough to understand the function of the
Server-class anyway. Now, let&rsquo;s skip forward in the code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>None of this has been used before, but it&rsquo;s all pretty obvious; set <code>client</code> (
which is an already connected socket) as the socket on which to transport the
SSH session, add a keyfile, build a server-object and use that as the server.
The explanation for this is</p>

<blockquote><p>configure the authentication methods</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, what? I guess this is technically correct, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain
<em>anything</em>. Sure, it&rsquo;s not that hard to understand, but still. The thing that
really annoys me is this: <code>bhSession.start_server(server=server)</code>. <code>bhSession</code>
is a paramiko-object of some kind, and to that objects member function
<code>start_server()</code> we pass our homebrewed Server-class. This means that, since
it will be used by a function in a library, the Server-class have to have some
functions and variables that should respond to different things. These are quite
important pieces of information if you want to build something yourself rather
than just copy and paste from a book. Alas, if I want to learn that I have to
consult the Paramiko documentation, because there isn&rsquo;t an explanation within
sight in the book.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind reading documentation, but I do mind paying $34 for a book
that supposedly should teach me something, only to be forced to read open
documentation if I want more understanding than copying, pasting and running can
give. Fortunately I got the book in a HumbleBundle, so I hardly payed for it.
And maybe it gets better later in the book, but right now I don&rsquo;t have time to
find out. As I said, this is very much a first imporession of the book and I
will get back to it. I just really think it&rsquo;s a shame that they didn&rsquo;t make it
twice as long (it&rsquo;s just short of 165 pages) and elaborated on the explanations
more, so that you don&rsquo;t need to consult the documentation to understand what&rsquo;s
going on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for my rant on this book. I&rsquo;ll revisit it Sometimeâ„¢ and write a real
review. But for now this will have to do. I&rsquo;ll have a review on another book I
recently read shortly, but until then</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
