<div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are again, I&rsquo;ve actually read another book. That makes four this year,
out of which three have been on some form of computer related topic. So my
New Year&rsquo;s resolution to read twelve books this year is actually looking like
it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

<p>But enough beating around be bush, if you&rsquo;re reading this it&rsquo;s because you want
to know what I think of <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ace/media/gray-hat-hacking.pdf">Gray Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</a>,
so here&rsquo;s what I think of it: I&rsquo;m not sure. I think that I may be a poor judge,
because I was expecting more than I got. See, this book is quite praised in
hacker circles, at least as I remember it from the days when I used to hang out
in hacker forums. It is one of <em>the</em> books you should read if you want to get
into the world of hacking. So knowing this I obviously expected miracles, more
or less, when I started reading. Unfortunately, that is not what <em>I</em> got.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I want to point out a few things. Firstly, I have not
read this cover to cover. I&rsquo;ve read the better part of it, but I&rsquo;ve skipped
quite some text that I didn&rsquo;t have a need for right now. This mostly involves
fluff like how to use specific tools, what it means to be an <em>Ethical Hacker</em>.
Secondly, since I have an education in computer security where I have actually
had this book as course literature (I didn&rsquo;t read it at the time though), I knew
a lot of these things before. This is part of the reason why I didn&rsquo;t get the
miracle I was expecting. With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get into the meat of'er!</p>

<p>The book quite hefty at 672 pages. It covers <em>a lot</em> of topics, ranging from how
to report found vulnerabilities to basic programming (I&rsquo;m coming back to this
later) to quite advanced tricks to get around protection schemes. This is why I
believe that it&rsquo;s considered such a good book to read if you want to enter the
world of hacking; it does give an introduction to a great many things. However,
some of these fields are covered so briefly that they might as well have left
them out. This includes SQL and XSS injections, that are only really touched
upon. Other topics, buffer overflows in particular, are elaborated on. The
explanations of these topics are well composed, with working(ish) examples,
complete with code, explanations and references. This allow you to follow along
for the most part, which is great! As opposed to Black Hat Python, where the
code examples comes first and the explanation afterwards, here the explanation
of the vulnerability comes first and the exploit is then iteratively
constructed, showing all steps along the way. The only real problem I have with
this is that their type setting for the code segment is quite bad, and sometimes
separate lines are printed on the same line. This is really a minor complaint
though.</p>

<p>One thing that is not the books fault, but decreases the value of it none the
less, is that it is a book and it&rsquo;s written in 2011. This means that some of the
things brought up in it is no longer possible, or no longer relevant. For
instance, the book walked throught the process of injecting shellcode via the
<code>.dtors</code> section of a program (I&rsquo;m not explaining that further, not in this
post at least). That section is replaces with <code>.fini_array</code> since GCC 4.7, which
works differently and makes the covered attack impossible. There&rsquo;s likely a
similar attack that exploits the new format, but for obvious reasons the book
doesn&rsquo;t cover it. There are a number of such instances, but as mentioned it&rsquo;s
not the fault of the authors but rather the ever-changing nature of the field.</p>

<p>Another thing that I find strange about the book is it&rsquo;s pacing. It&rsquo;s covering
fairly advanced attacks and how to construct your own shellcode, while at the
same time covering basic programming. This section is really quite short and as
I&rsquo;m quite adept at programming I only skimmed it, but I could see that it was on
the level of &ldquo;every C program needs a function called <code>main()</code>&rdquo;. In other words,
that part of the text was aimed at someone who has never seen a line of code.
This is odd to me, as security is no basic topic. Sure, there are a ton of
script kiddies who run around on the interwebs thinking they&rsquo;re 1337 hax0rz
because the figured out how to download LOIC (or whatever is the latest and
greatest DDoS tool now-a-days), but this is a book that aims to educate security
professionals. Demanding a certain amount of previous knowledge of how C,
memory and such works would not be too much to ask in my opinion. Especially
when, as I said, shellcode construction is covered. This involves writing
(short) C programs that do what you want, compiling them and removing any
unnecessary ASM that the compiler added, only to then assemble and extract the
opcodes. In other words, it&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;d be able to do confidently if you
don&rsquo;t know C before you start reading.</p>

<p>Apart from this I like the book. I didn&rsquo;t get much out of it, but that is
because I already knew most of it. The parts I didn&rsquo;t know where quite
interesting to read about, and as I said it covers the topics well. Because of
this I&rsquo;d agree with the statement that this is one of <em>the books</em> to read if you
want to get going with <em>ethical</em> hacking. Do yourself a favour and wait until
you&rsquo;re at least somewhat proficient in C and x86 assembler before you pick up
the book though, as you might have a hard time understanding some of the
examples otherwise.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, I hope you enjoyed this.. reviewish. Until next time,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
