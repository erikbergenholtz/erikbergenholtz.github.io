<div class="entry-content"><p>I am an avid coffee drinker. I love a strong cup of joe any time of day, and I
really enjoy making espressos, cappuccinos, lattes, etc. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to
see a coffee post on here some time in the future. This post, however, is not
about coffee,but it started out as a discussion about coffee on Discord.</p>

<p>We talked about how coffee is an important part of the day, when a friend on
the server said that they&rsquo;re sensitive to coffee and have to drink decaf,
which is hard to come by if you want quality goods. After stating that tea is
probably the closest you can get to coffee without it being coffee, we came to
the conclusion that coffee and tea are basically the same thing; coffee is just
&ldquo;coffee bean tea&rdquo;. This statement sparked an idea; if coffee is just tea,
does that mean that we can use tea in the same way as we use coffee? For
instance, can we make espresso using tea? Obviously it&rsquo;s possible to put tea in
an espresso machine, but how does it turn out? I felt that I had to try, so
that&rsquo;s what this post is about.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/grounds.jpg" title="Tea grounds" ></p>

<p>First off I needed the actual tea. I have made teaspresso on three kinds of
tea: a black tea, a green tea (with some dried fruit) and a rooibos tea.
Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t know more about the tea, because I bought them a while
back. Coffee is ground quite finely when making espresso, to help build up
pressure in the filter among other things. Because of this I ground the tea
with a mortar and pestle somewhat finely. In the image above, the green tea is
to the right, the rooibos is in the middle, and the black is to the left.
The pulled shots are in the picture below, and they&rsquo;re in the same order as in
the picture of the grounds.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/comparison.jpg" title="The three shots side by side" ></p>

<p>First out is the black tea, which is being pulled in the picture to the right.
To my surprise the tea actually got quite a nice crema. Not in the same way as a
good cup of espresso of course, but there was still a crema on the shot.
<img class="right" src="/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/black.jpg" width="200" title="Black shot being pulled" >
The tea itself didn&rsquo;t smell a lot (disclaimer: my sense of smell is somewhat
reduced, so I might be wrong about this), but it smelled of black tea. The
texture of the teaspresso was quite silky, almost in the same way an espresso
is. It tasted pleasantly tea-y, with all the sweet notes and none of the bitter
notes. It was also somewhat tart with a citrus feeling to it. It did not taste
a lot. As an espresso tastes like a really strong cup of coffee (well, not
quite, but you get the picture) I expected the same from the tea, but I was
wrong. If I would&rsquo;ve brewed the tea normally and steeped it for say 5-6
minutes it would likely have tasted more than this did. The teaspresso did
taste somewhat differently though. In a pleasant way.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/rooibos.jpg" width="200" title="Rooibos shot being pulled" >
I moved on to the rooibos. Same procedure as last time. The color of is shot
was amazing, especially while pulling it. A lovely orange hue. The color did
tone down a bit once the teaspresso settled, but it was still quite a livid
color. Taste wise, this was a completely different beast than the black tea.
Firstly, this smelled of rooibos tea <em>a lot</em>. Secondly, this tea really packed
a punch. It didn&rsquo;t taste tea very much, but was instead intensely peppery.
It was almost like biting black pepper, but not quite as strong. The texture
wasn&rsquo;t as silky as the black teaspresso, and it had an aftertaste that I could
not quite identify. A very different experience, but not an unpleasant one.
Maybe not something anyone would like, but I sure did.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/2017/08/13/teaspresso/green.jpg" width="200" title="Green shot being pulled" >
Finally there&rsquo;s the green tea. It had almost no smell (again, I&rsquo;m not the best
judge of this), but it had much taste. Unfortunately, it was not a good taste.
The green teaspresso was incredibly bitter, and left a very dry feeling in my
mouth. It did have some sweetness hiding behind the bitterness which came
forward if you sipped it in very small amounts. A friend on the Discord-channel
tried as well and didn&rsquo;t feel it though. Since he didn&rsquo;t have any dried fruit
in his tea, the dried fruit in mine might&rsquo;ve been what added the sweetness to
my shot. All in all this was not good at all, and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>

<p>Conclusions then. I think this was an exciting experiment, and I&rsquo;d like to try
this with other kinds of tea as well (yerba mate and white tea are next)
on the list. We discussed the failure of the green tea on Discord, and
theorized that the increased surface area of the ground tea might very well
mean that more tannines are released into the water, making it bitter. I&rsquo;m
therefore considering pulling another shot of the green teaspresso without
grinding the leaves and see if that turns out better.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this, I sure did! You might expect to see more stuff like
this, both on tea, coffee and perhaps the occasional cocktail. Only time will
tell. Until next time!</p>

<p>Happy (tea) Hacking</p>
