<p>A new year has started, and as such it&rsquo;s time to once again summarize the past
year and make grand new year&rsquo;s resolutions that you won&rsquo;t keep yourself
accountable for. However, this year I decided that I&rsquo;d do something slightly
more concrete than just telling myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be healthy and get swole&rdquo;. So
I went ahead and made a bucket list, consisting of things that I want to get
done in the year to come. My plan is to revisit and revise it each month,
adding new things as they pop up and crossing out things that I have done.
However, I am not going to remove anything unless I can justify it with a very
good reason (like sickness for training goals, for instace). But first, let&rsquo;s
very quickly revisit last year.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/31/new-year-higher-resolution/">my post last year</a>
I vowed to read more books. Specifically, I wanted to read one book a month. I
also wanted to eat no excessive sugar for 100 days, and start running once a
week. I didn&rsquo;t do the last two things. Like at all. I think I went out running
a few times, but then I stopped. I forgot about the sugar thing about as soon
as I&rsquo;d posted about it. Oops. The reading, on the other hand, went quite well.
I&rsquo;ve read <em>A Cloclwork Orange</em>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/01/14/review-learn-you-a-haskell/"><em>Learn you a Haskell for Great Good</em></a>,
<em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/11/my-thoughts-on-gray-hat-hacking/"><em>Grey Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</em></a>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/20/book-review-ansible-from-beginner-to-pro/"><em>Ansible: From Beginner to Pro</em></a>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/30/book-review-exploding-the-phone-by-phil-lapsley/"><em>Exploding the Phone</em></a>,
and <em>The Hellbound Heart</em>. It&rsquo;s not the twelve books I wanted to read, but it
is seven, which is seven more than I read the year before that. Frankly, I am
quite satisfied with this.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s the bucketlist for 2018:</p>

<p>There it is! The huge list of stuff I want to get done this year. My goals for
the coming month is to finish reading <em>The Graveyard Book</em>, because I&rsquo;m halfway
through it, and to finish playing <em>Mario Odyssey</em> for the same reason. We have
started eating keto already, but I&rsquo;m not ticking that off until it&rsquo;s clear that
we&rsquo;re sticking to it. I&rsquo;m also going to try Aikido, hopefully.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with my quest to become a better human
anymore, and move on to actually <em>being</em> one. In about three weeks, this list
will be revisited and revised!</p>

<p>Until then,<br/>
Happy Hacking!</p>
