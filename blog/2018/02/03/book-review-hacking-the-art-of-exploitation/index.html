<div class="entry-content"><p><em>This review was supposed to be published some months ago (in July last year,
to be specific), but wasn&rsquo;t because I put it in a folder where I&rsquo;d be sure to
find it again and then, of course, didn&rsquo;t. So if there&rsquo;s anything in there that
doesn&rsquo;t make sense in the context of having read the book now, rather than
during last year&rsquo;s vacation, it&rsquo;s because I did read it during last year&rsquo;s
vacation. Regardless, I stand by my opinion on the book, so here&rsquo;s the review.</em></p>

<p>Here it is. My review of <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm">Hacking - The Art of Exploitation</a></em>
by Jon Erickson, published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com">No Starch Press</a> (of
course). It&rsquo;s a book I first learned about many a year ago when I first got
interested for real in computer security, so somewhere around seven years ago.
Like <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em>, this is one of <em>the</em> books to read as an asipring
hacker according to the hacker community (at least it was back then). I bought
a copy of the book 2013, and it&rsquo;s been gathering dust on my bookshelf since. But
now, finally, I&rsquo;ve read it. So what are we waiting for, let&rsquo;s jump right in!</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em>, which tries to be an introduction to many fields of
security, <em>The Art of Exploitation</em> tries to be an introduction to one aspect of
security, namely writing exploits. As a result, it goes further into depth in
this one subject than <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em> does in any subject, including
programming. A fundamental part of writing exploits is to understand how
computers work at a low level, and <em>The Art of Exploitation</em> aims to teach you
just that. Because of this, the first 100 pages of the book covers C programming
and some general x86 assymbly. I&rsquo;m aware that I gave <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em> a bit
of a bashing for covering programming, because I believe that you should know
programming before getting into hacking, but here it&rsquo;s much more in depth and
well explained. <em>Gray Hat Hacking</em> stopped at showing off if-statements and
for-loops, while <em>Art of Exploitation</em> goes all the way to dynamic memory,
function pointers, structs and file access. It also shows some of the basics of
GDB, end explains the stack, the heap and the different memory segments that are
used in a program. All in all, I believe that if you read the first chapter
carefully, do some exercises and write some programs yourself, you&rsquo;d be pretty
confident with C afterwards. Granted, you&rsquo;ll have to put down time to actually
learn how to write programs from a specification of course, but at least you
would know how to write the code once the structure of it is determined.</p>

<p>The rest of the book is more or less dedicated to exploiting. The second chapter
shows how a number of exploits like buffer overflows and fromat string exploits
work, and it does so by example. Accompanying the book is a LiveCD with an
Ubuntu installation containing all the tools and code used in the book. All
examples are walked through, step by step, and clearly show how to find the
vulnerability in the given program, how to construct the exploit and how to
execute it. The chapter following this takes this to the next level by adding
networking to the mix. It starts off by talking about networks in general,
explaining the OSI model layer by layer, and then moves on to some network
programming using both the <code>socket()</code> interface in C, as well as more abstract
libraries like <code>libnet</code> and <code>libpcap</code>. It finally explains how to write tools
for things like DoS attacks, ARP spoofing and TCP/IP hijacking. Once networking
is covered, the book moves on to showing how to write your own shellcode, as up
to this point all the shellcode has been predesigned to do the right thing. It
goes through how to use syscalls to do what you want, how to open up shells,
bind shells to network connections, and how to optimize the shellcode. Next,
countermeasures are covered as well as ways around these countermeasures.
Finally, a brief and high level introduction to cryprology is given, which shows
off how to break RC4 (the cryptographic function used by WEP) among other
things.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the book does cover a lot of things, but it&rsquo;s still quite
focused. Most of the exploits that are shown are based on the idea of injecting
code into a running program, and redirecting the execution of the program to the
injected code. Because of this, and the fact that all the exploits are written
by the reader and not just executed by a prebuilt tool, the book doesn&rsquo;t feel
too spread out and also manages to convey understanding on the subjects, rather
than being a glorified manpage. Apart from this, the text is also quite
approachable, which makes it easy to take in the information. The examples are
worked through step by step, showing all the steps along the way, and the steps
are clearly explained. Many of the programs being exploited are quite trivial
and have blindingly obvious flaws, but the point of the book is not to become a
1337 h4xXx0R^ that can <a href="https://youtu.be/Bmz67ErIRa4">hack the Gibson</a>, but to
get the reader into the mindset of a hacker and to know what kinds of flaws to
look for when trying to find exploits in real life software. This is something
it does a great job with.</p>

<p>One thing you might&rsquo;ve noticed is that I mentioned that all the code is readily
available on the supplied LiveCD, but I didn&rsquo;t complain about it like I did with
<em>Black Hat Python</em>. This might seem hypocritical, but I have my reasons for
thinking it&rsquo;s okay with this book. Firtly, most of the things that the book
actually tries to teach you are concepts that can&rsquo;t really be put into code.
Sure, you can just read the book, see all the examples in GDB that are shown in
the book, and then pat yourself on the back for becoming a hacker. But if you
want to actually try running any of the exploits to see them in action, you&rsquo;ll
have to do some work yourself as memory addresses changes. Moreover, most of
the supplied code is either shellcode that you need prebuilt until the fourth
chapter of book, or programs that you&rsquo;ll try to exploit. Writing these yourself
if of course very good exercise, but for someone like me who knows programming
quite well and just want to learn how to write exploit, having to write the
500 line web server myself would just be a distraction. Having the code
available, ready to be compiled, lets you focus on what the book actually is
about. Another redeeming factor is that the book actually explains what&rsquo;s being
attempted <em>before</em> showing the code in the book, so you can give it a go first.
Because of these things, I appreciate the code being available.</p>

<p>So, to wrap this up, did I learn something, and who would I recommend this to?
The answer to the first question is undoubtably &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I learned quite a bit.
I knew of most attacks since before, but reading this gave me a better
understanding of why they work, and how. I also learned that I need to get
better at assembler, because optimizing shellcode for both size and to remove
NULL-bytes can be a bit tricky. In other words, expect a review on an ASM book
some time in the future. The answer to the second question is a bit more tricky.
On the one hand I think this is a book that, in part at least, would benefit
everyone who does software development at some level. On the other hand it might
be a bit too in-depth if your only goal is to understand how the exploits work
on a high level to know what to avoid doing. Because of this, I think I&rsquo;m going
to settle for the answer that anyone who is interested in security should read
this book, everyone else might want to skim some of it but maybe not read the
whole thing cover to cover. Also, I do think that because of the thorough
introduction to programming in the beginning, as long as you&rsquo;re taking the time
to work through everything and not just use the prebuilt code, people of any
level should be able to follow reasonably well. I do still think you should have
a firm grasp of how computers work <em>before</em> you delve into security though.</p>

<p>That being said, I am now off to do.. other things. I&rsquo;m thinking of picking up
<em>Web application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</em> and work through that, or try to find a nice
VM with juicy vulnerabilities to practice on. Regardless, I&rsquo;ll see you later!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
