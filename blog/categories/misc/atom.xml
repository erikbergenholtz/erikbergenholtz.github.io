    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know, I know. I was supposed to update this thing once a month. But being a
PhD student is hectic. Who would&rsquo;ve guessed? I also realized in March that since
I more or less don&rsquo;t ever put anything here, my entire blog would be just this
list being reposted over and over. So I decided to reduce the frequency a bit.
As long as I actually do follow up on these things, right?</p>

<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve done a lot since the last update. I&rsquo;ve finished a bunch of games
(that weren&rsquo;t on the list, of course), I&rsquo;ve <em>almost</em> stopped biting my nails
(I did actually stop for a couple of weeks, but then I got a small wound and I
was back at it..). I have read about one third (I think) of <em>Tinker Tailor
Solider Spy</em>. And, most importantly, I&rsquo;m about to submit my first paper. So I&rsquo;ve
got a lot going on.</p>

<p>But I <em>have</em> actually finished a couple of things as well. I&rsquo;ve fixed my home
network, so there aren&rsquo;t ethernet cables snaking their way over the floor
anymore. I&rsquo;ve read most of <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>, which I&rsquo;m going to
count as done because I realized while reading it that it&rsquo;s not a cover-to-cover
kind of book. I&rsquo;ve also nailed the Advanced Algorithms course I took. Good
stuff! So I haven&rsquo;t been lazy just because I haven&rsquo;t reposted this list,
alright?</p>

<p>Before I sign off here I&rsquo;d just like to say that I have a couple of posts
planned actually, and I hope to finish them over vacation. They&rsquo;re going to be a
bit more technical than the stuff I&rsquo;ve posted so far. And with a bit I mean &ldquo;a
lot&rdquo;. Like fiddling around with raw sockets in C technical. But that&rsquo;s for
later, hopefully during the summer. For now, this is all.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <updated>2018-02-28T23:00:38+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/02/28/2018-bucket-list-february-progress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is time yet again for a revisit to the <a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/01/03/bucket-list-of-2018/">bucket list</a> of 2018. So what have
I actually accomplished this month? Sadly very little, I&rsquo;m afraid. There&rsquo;s been
a lot of playing PUBG, but not much else. I <em>have</em> started reading <em>Konsten att
f mentala superkrafter</em> as well as <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>, but I&rsquo;ve
finished neither so far. The one thing I have finished on the list is playing
Subnautica. I finished the game the other day (there might be a post about this
amazing creating later on), so that is quite nice. At least one thing ticked
off.</p>

<p>Now, for new additions to the list. Firstly, I&rsquo;ve decided that my new hobby is
food and drinks in all forms. With this in mind I&rsquo;m going to add <em>Get better at
cooking</em>, <em>Learn about fermenting</em> and <em>Learn about brewing</em>. Unfortunately
these goals are faily fluffy, so I&rsquo;ll try to come up with a way to define them
better. Other than this I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything else that I want to add
to the list. That gives us the list below after two months of 2018, and with
that I&rsquo;m signing off here.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/02/03/2018-bucket-list-january-progress/"/>
    <updated>2018-02-03T22:49:50+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/02/03/2018-bucket-list-january-progress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There we are. The first month of 2018 has passed, and so it is time for me to
revisit the <a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/01/03/bucket-list-of-2018/">bucket list</a>
I made back in the beginning of the year. So the big question is what&rsquo;s happened
during this month? Unfortunately, not as much as I wished would happen. But
that&rsquo;s alright, because we&rsquo;ve got another 11 months to go before all these
things are supposed to be ticked off.</p>

<p>What has happeden though is that I have finished reading <em>The Grabeyard Book</em>, I
have finished <em>Mario Odyssey</em> (or, well, the main part of the game anyway, I
know there&rsquo;s more content to unlock by slaving away with collecting star shaped
power moons, but I&rsquo;m not going to count that), and I&rsquo;ve started eating a
ketogenic diet successfully. No carbs for a month now (almost).</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done. What&rsquo;s up next then? Well, I&rsquo;ve started to read
<em>Konsten att få Metala Superkrafter</em>, which is a selfhelp book that supposedly
should help you boost memory, reading speed, creativity, etc. I&rsquo;m slightly
skeptical, but I know that the author is legit, and since all of the skills that
will supposedly be boosted are good things for a PhD student to boost, I thought
I might as well give it a go. I also hope to finish the German course on
Duolingo until the end of February. To do that I need to finish roughly 3
lessons a day for the whole month. I&rsquo;ll do my best, but it might be a bit much;
I tend to get frustrated with Duolingo because of it&rsquo;s poor design. Finally, I
plan to fix the home network quite soon. I only need to buy some equipment.</p>

<p>Finally, are there any new points to the list? Of course there are! Firstly,
<em>Subnautica</em> is added to the list of games I want to finish (which shouldn&rsquo;t be
too hard to pull off, considering that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m playing right now). Secondly
I&rsquo;m adding <em>Bioshock - Rapture</em> to the list of fiction I want to read, simply
because I loved the Bioshock games and want to experience more of what Rapture
has to offer. Other than that, nothing springs to mind at the moment. So that
leaves us with the list below. And with that, I am going to finish this post.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/01/03/bucket-list-of-2018/"/>
    <updated>2018-01-03T19:45:38+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2018/01/03/bucket-list-of-2018</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new year has started, and as such it&rsquo;s time to once again summarize the past
year and make grand new year&rsquo;s resolutions that you won&rsquo;t keep yourself
accountable for. However, this year I decided that I&rsquo;d do something slightly
more concrete than just telling myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be healthy and get swole&rdquo;. So
I went ahead and made a bucket list, consisting of things that I want to get
done in the year to come. My plan is to revisit and revise it each month,
adding new things as they pop up and crossing out things that I have done.
However, I am not going to remove anything unless I can justify it with a very
good reason (like sickness for training goals, for instace). But first, let&rsquo;s
very quickly revisit last year.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2016/12/31/new-year-higher-resolution/">my post last year</a>
I vowed to read more books. Specifically, I wanted to read one book a month. I
also wanted to eat no excessive sugar for 100 days, and start running once a
week. I didn&rsquo;t do the last two things. Like at all. I think I went out running
a few times, but then I stopped. I forgot about the sugar thing about as soon
as I&rsquo;d posted about it. Oops. The reading, on the other hand, went quite well.
I&rsquo;ve read <em>A Cloclwork Orange</em>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/01/14/review-learn-you-a-haskell/"><em>Learn you a Haskell for Great Good</em></a>,
<em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/11/my-thoughts-on-gray-hat-hacking/"><em>Grey Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</em></a>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/20/book-review-ansible-from-beginner-to-pro/"><em>Ansible: From Beginner to Pro</em></a>,
<a href="http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/30/book-review-exploding-the-phone-by-phil-lapsley/"><em>Exploding the Phone</em></a>,
and <em>The Hellbound Heart</em>. It&rsquo;s not the twelve books I wanted to read, but it
is seven, which is seven more than I read the year before that. Frankly, I am
quite satisfied with this.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s the bucketlist for 2018:</p>

<ul>
<li>Books

<ul>
<li>Fiction

<ul>
<li>The Graveyard Book</li>
<li>Dune</li>
<li>Tinker Tailor Solider Spy</li>
<li>House of Leaves</li>
<li>The King in Yellow</li>
<li>1984</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-fiction

<ul>
<li>Introduction to Algorithms</li>
<li>Violent Python</li>
<li>Art of Intrusion</li>
<li>Art of Deception</li>
<li>Web Application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</li>
<li>Practical Malware Analysis</li>
<li>Get Started in German</li>
<li>Konsten att få Metala Superkrafter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Movies

<ul>
<li>Dune</li>
<li>Brazil</li>
<li>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</li>
<li>Django Unchained</li>
<li>The Hateful Eight</li>
<li>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny</li>
<li>Soylent Green</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Games

<ul>
<li>Mario Odyssey</li>
<li>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
<li>DOOM</li>
<li>Cuphead</li>
<li>Dishonored 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work

<ul>
<li>Nail Advanced Algorithms</li>
<li>Two publications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health and fitness

<ul>
<li>Start working out</li>
<li>Try Aikido</li>
<li>Start eating Keto</li>
<li>Quit nailbiting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other

<ul>
<li>Start practicing violin/viola regularly</li>
<li>Fix home network</li>
<li>Fix battlestation</li>
<li>Git gud at hacking</li>
<li>Finish German course on Duolingo</li>
<li>Finish <em>Get Started in German</em></li>
<li>Get more into tea and coffee</li>
<li>Start posting here regularly, preferably about sciency stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>There it is! The huge list of stuff I want to get done this year. My goals for
the coming month is to finish reading <em>The Graveyard Book</em>, because I&rsquo;m halfway
through it, and to finish playing <em>Mario Odyssey</em> for the same reason. We have
started eating keto already, but I&rsquo;m not ticking that off until it&rsquo;s clear that
we&rsquo;re sticking to it. I&rsquo;m also going to try Aikido, hopefully.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with my quest to become a better human
anymore, and move on to actually <em>being</em> one. In about three weeks, this list
will be revisited and revised!</p>

<p>Until then,<br/>
Happy Hacking!</p>

    <updated>2017-07-18T15:42:24+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erikbergenholtz.se/blog/2017/07/18/hello-world-v3-dot-0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, here we are agian. Yet another change of blogging platform. This one is
here to stay, at least of a while. I promise.</p>

<p>So why do I change once again? Well, the reason is simple: time. I have a lot
of things I <em>want</em> to add to my old blog, like commenting and possibly RSS and
stuff, but I don&rsquo;t really have the time. So I went looking for a suitable
platform, and found this. Like my old blog this renders Markdown, but it also
does syntax highlighting and stuff more efficiently than my old blog. So this
is what I&rsquo;ll go with.</p>

<p>Am I going to abandon my old blog then? No, not quite. I don&rsquo;t plan on using
it as my blogging platform anytime in the near future, but I do plan to keep it
alive and well inside a VM and keep developing it. So maybe I&rsquo;ll use it again
in the future, who knows? But for now it&rsquo;s only going to be a side project, the
progress of which I&rsquo;ll share here.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;m going to migrate all the old posts to this
platform, but it might take a bit of time because of formatting differences
and stuff. Until next time!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
