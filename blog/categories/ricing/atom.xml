    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished a small project that I wanted to share with the rest of you.
What I&rsquo;ve done is a home screen for your browser that at least I think is
pretty good looking (see screenshot below) and faily easy to customize. The
page uses a number of simple JavaScripts (that could probably be improved) to
print a nifty, randomized title on the page, as well as dynamically build links
to the sites you frequent.</p>

<p>If you think this looks nice and want to try it out, all instructions you
should need to get it up and running to your liking is on the
<a href="https://github.com/Psyberion/homepage">repo on github</a>, so I&rsquo;m not going to
say more about it, but leave you with a screenshot.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a while, and since I have something to share I
thought this might be a good time to pick up this blogging
business again.</p>

<p>I have started with Linux ricing, i.e. doing &ldquo;unecessary
modifications&rdquo; to my Linux system. I&rsquo;ve only been at it
for little more than a day, but I must say that I quite
enjoy it. There&rsquo;s a long way to go before I get to one
of the increadible ricings displayed over at
<a href="http://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a>, which is a
subreddit devoted to UNIX ricing. But I would say that
my current rice is at least a decent start.</p>

<p>I will keep up the good work, and hope to one day
reach a wizardly look on my Debian system!</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in trying my rice out,
or have a look at the dotfiles, they&rsquo;re all
<a href="https://github.com/Psyberion/ricedotfiles">available here</a>.</p>
