  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but now I am finally done reading
<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, so it is
time for me not only to get coding, but also to review the book!</p>

<p>Haskell is a language that I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing for quite some time, but I have
hesitated to get started with it due to it being a functional programming
language. As a guy coming from a mainly imperative background (I do most work
in C or Python), this is quite different and without a good tutorial it seemed
quite inaccessible. Luckily for me, Learn You a Haskell showed up on
<a href="https://humblebundle.com">HumbleBundle</a> a while ago, so I took the opportunity
to buy it.</p>

<p>The book is aimed at people like me: people experienced in programming, but new
to functional programming. The book guides the reader though the core concepts
of Haskell in a conversational tone that is riddled with examples. The language
is easy to follow, and new concepts are described clearly. The powerfulness of
the language is shown both through descriptions in the text, but also with the
examples. In general I would say that it&rsquo;s a really good book that is very
worth reading.</p>

<p>However, the book has one downside; its lack of exercises. As mentioned, it is
full of examples, and they do great job at showing how things work and how
powerful the language is when used correctly. Unfortunately there are no clear
exercises. Some of the examples are extended through description, where the
actual implementation of the extension is left as an exercise to the reader,
but as someone who want to learn how to work with the language and have never
done anything functional before it is hard to come up with exercises for
yourself. I really do think that the book would benefit a lot from having
explicit tasks to do yourself at the end of each chapter. As it is now, I am
quite confident that I understand the concepts of the language after reading
the book, but I am far from confident with coding in it. Of course I would not
have become a Haskell wizard by reading the book even if it did have exercises,
but I think I would&rsquo;ve been closer.</p>

<p>Regardless I think that it is a really good book, and a really good
introduction to both Haskell and functional programming, and I am looking
forward to getting to know Haskell in a more practical way. As a final note
I&rsquo;d like to recommend it if you&rsquo;re interested in learning Haskell. There are a
lot of very large and crooked questionmarks surrounding the world of functional
programming if you&rsquo;re from an imperative or object oriented background, but the
book does a great job of straightening those into exclamation marks.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to delve into the next book, which will be
<a href="http://users.metu.edu.tr/serge/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf">How to Prove it</a>,
a review of that will come when I&rsquo;m done working through it.</p>

<p>Until the next time,</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<time class='entry-date' datetime='2016-12-31T23:00:00+01:00'><span class='date'>2016-12-31</span> <span class='time'>11:00 pm</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s a new year, which means that it&rsquo;s time to make new year&rsquo;s resolutions that
you&rsquo;re not going to keep. Or maybe you will! I for one will really try to keep
mine, because I really want to make myself a better person. So what are my
new year&rsquo;s resolutions going to be?</p>

<p>First off, and I know that I&rsquo;ve said this a few times before, I am going to
read more. For reals this time. Thing is that I have a ton of books, both
fictional and factual, that I&rsquo;ve been eager to read. However, I have a severe
case of &ldquo;積ん読&rdquo; or <em>tsundoku</em>. It&rsquo;s a Japanese word for &ldquo;buying books
but not reading them&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku">seriously</a>).
Now I want to stop having this.. &ldquo;condition&rdquo;, I want to start reading. Not only
because books are expensive and I should not spend money unnecessarily, but
also because what I do when I don&rsquo;t read is quite stupid. Usually, I just
imgur or reddit, or play some game. Sure, gaming is good for relaxing, but so
is learning new things. So, my plan is to spend less time browsing reddit and
more time reading things. So, new year&rsquo;s resolution number one is that I shall
read one book a month.</p>

<p>The second one is something I am going to do together with my girlfriend. We&rsquo;re
going to not consume any unnecessary sugar for 100 days. This means no candy,
soda, alcohol, cookies or anything else like that for one hundred days, i.e.
until April 9th. We&rsquo;re not going to over do it, so sugar in food products is
OK.</p>

<p>Lastly there&rsquo;s the obligatory &ldquo;get in shape&rdquo; resolution. I have these fancy
(but ugly) Vibram Fivefinger shoes that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been using too little. So I&rsquo;m
going to take up running again, at least once a week. Also I&rsquo;m going to try to
start lifting weights down at the gym. I&rsquo;m doing this not only to become a
Greek god (which I obviously will become), but also to relieve some stress.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s my three new year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading one book a month, be it fictional or educational</li>
<li>No excess sugar for 100 days</li>
<li>Start running at least once a week</li>
</ul>


<p>So that&rsquo;s it for this post. Sorry for deluding you into thinking I was getting
a 4k monitor or something that cool for the new year. Hopefully I will update
my rig during the year, and I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on that, but for now this is
all.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought that the next post I was going to do would be one on higher order
functions. In fact, I started writing one a couple of times, but it just didn&rsquo;t
seem necessary. Why was that? Well, it all actually made sense. I had a read
through the chapter, and the theory wan&rsquo;t that hard. Once I had also
reimplemented the fold and scan functions recusively myself I felt that I had
a quite solid grip on higher order functions. And man, are they powerful!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve moved forward, past modules and into the end of defining my own
data types. While that is itself quite straight forward, there are quite
a few things that aren&rsquo;t exactly odd, but they need to be remebered, so I&rsquo;m
jotting it down here.</p>

<p>To star off, if you want to define a new data type you use the <code>data</code> keyword.
It looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Green</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a data type called <code>TrafficLight</code>, of which we can create the
values <code>Red</code>, <code>Yellow</code> and <code>Green</code> using it&rsquo;s <em>value constructors</em>. While this
is a perfectly fine class, we can&rsquo;t print it to the terminal, read it from a
string, order it or check if it&rsquo;s values are equal at present. To fix that we
could do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Read</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Ord</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This allow us to do everything stated above. The <code>Eq</code> type class (we&rsquo;ll get to
that later) allow us to equate elements. The default behaviour is that
<code>Red == Red</code> is true, while <code>Red == Green</code> is false. The <code>Ord</code> allow us to
order the values. The default behaviour for this type class is that the value
constructors <em>to the left</em> are <strong>smaller</strong> than the ones on the right. I.e., in
this example <code>Red &lt; Green</code> is true while <code>Yellow &gt; Green</code> is false, because of
the order they&rsquo;re defined in the type definition.</p>

<p>It is also possible to define a new data type using a class constructor. This
is something that&rsquo;s been used in the type definitions of functions through out
the book, and isn&rsquo;t that strange really. For instance, a simple binary search
tree could be implemented like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Ord</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using this kind of declaration, it is possible to store any data type in the
tree, as long as it is orderable and equatable. Which makes sense, since it&rsquo;s a
BST.</p>

<p>We can also use the register syntax to add some additional context to our data
type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Person</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">firstname</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lastname</span>  <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">birthyear</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All this is quite straight forward, if a bit much to take in all at once. But
it quite makes sense anyway. Now, let&rsquo;s get into the really strange things.
Let&rsquo;s start off with instances.</p>

<p>Earlier I showed that in order to make the value constructors of a class
equatable (is that even a word? Sounds weird) you need to derive the <code>Eq</code> type
class in your data type. This imposes some default behaviour, as described. If
you for some reason aren&rsquo;t happy with this default behaviour you can go around
it by making your type an <em>instance</em> of <code>Eq</code>, like this (I&rsquo;m using the
TrafficLight type for this example):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This basically says that <code>Red == Red</code> is true, and so is <code>Yellow == Yellow</code> and
<code>Green == Green</code>. All other combinations, however, are false. This overrides
how <code>Eq</code> typically behaves (and in this case, replaces the behaviour with an
identical behaviour). I can really see how this is useful, as it bares some
resemblance to defining your own equality operator (or the like; this works for
any type class) in C++.</p>

<p>Next up is actual type classes, and inheritance from those. Coming from a (sort
of) object oriented (I bloody hate object oriented programming..) background,
this seems quite strange. A class in Haskell isn&rsquo;t like a class in C++; a bunch
of functions and variables crammed together into one name. In Haskel, it&rsquo;s just
a collection of type definitions for functions. In other words, it&rsquo;s kind of
like a C++ class with no variables and only virtual functions. If you have a
class that itself is a type constructor, then you can make the class a subclass
of another class. For instance, the <code>Ord</code> class is a subclass of <code>Eq</code>,
because it makes sense that any data types that are orderable are also
equatable.</p>

<p>As a grand finale of this monstrosity of a post, we have functors. Oh dear, how
weird functors seemed at first. A type class that is meant for things that can
be mapped. It sounded so strange at first, but once I realized how it could
be utilized for any data type that can either be empty, or contain something,
it was quite obvious how awesome this was. For instance, the <code>Tree</code> I
defined earlier has the following definition:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">derives</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, say I want to write a function that traverses all of the tree and applies
an arbitrary function to the values of each node. Using functors it&rsquo;s as easy
as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="kt">Functor</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! I tell Haskell that I want to make the Tree type an instance of the
Functor class, I define how I want the <code>fmap</code> function to act on the tree and
as a result I can now multiply all node values of a tree of integers like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">fmap</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">tree</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It goes over the tree and builds a new tree. Writing this I realize that doing
this with a normal function would actually work the exact same way, but I am
sure that functors have some advantage over normal functions that I just don&rsquo;t
see with my inexperienced eyes.</p>

<p>So, after a long read (both for me and you) we&rsquo;re finally at the end of this
post (and the chapters on types and classes in &ldquo;Learn you a Haskell&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s
been quite the journey, and it has taken me a couple of days to get here, which
makes sense considering I&rsquo;ve had to forget everything I know about classes. But
Haskell&rsquo;s type system seems really cool, and I look forward to getting to know
it better! But now I&rsquo;ll take a break. Until next time,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve just finished a small project that I wanted to share with the rest of you.
What I&rsquo;ve done is a home screen for your browser that at least I think is
pretty good looking (see screenshot below) and faily easy to customize. The
page uses a number of simple JavaScripts (that could probably be improved) to
print a nifty, randomized title on the page, as well as dynamically build links
to the sites you frequent.</p>

<p>If you think this looks nice and want to try it out, all instructions you
should need to get it up and running to your liking is on the
<a href="https://github.com/Psyberion/homepage">repo on github</a>, so I&rsquo;m not going to
say more about it, but leave you with a screenshot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are again, another post about Haskell. To star off I just want to say
that I am having a blast learning this, and that I think I am getting the
hang of it. I&rsquo;ve gone through recursion today, which isn&rsquo;t really a new concept
to me, but it&rsquo;s tricky to know what to do in a completely new language.
However, I managed to write all example function from the book on my own, which
I think is a sign that I am starting to get this. For instance, I came up with
this solution to writing quicksort:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So the only real differences is that I have one unnecessary case in my pattern
matching (<code>quicksort [x] = [x]</code>) and that I use <code>where</code> instead of <code>let</code>. I&rsquo;m
quite satisfied with that!</p>

<p>The next chapter is on currying, folds and other strange things. From what I
remember, these things all appeared very odd to me, so I think I&rsquo;ll take that
tomorrow instead. So I guess I didn&rsquo;t really learn that much today, but it&rsquo;s
nice to see that I am getting closer to understanding this language.</p>

<p>Anyway, expect a monster update when I&rsquo;m done with the next chapter, because
there&rsquo;ll be a lot to anchor in my mind by writing about it. Until then,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My mission to learn Haskell goes on, and I&rsquo;ve now  read about functions. As
Haskell is a purley functional language, it makes sense that functions are
quite important and well developed in the language. There are a lot of things
I really like with the way Haskell does functions that are strange in the eyes
of an imperative programmer, and I&rsquo;m going to jot some of it down here to try
to reinforce my own understanding of it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <em>guards</em>. In Haskell, a guard is basically a large if-else
statement. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">function</span> <span class="n">var</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">statement</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">statement</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For instance, if I want to build a function that returns <code>True</code> if the input is
even I could write it like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span><span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Integral</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This makes for code that is quite easy to read, especially when there are a lot
of different cases to match against. Speaking of cases, there are of course
switch-case statements in Haskell too, but just like if-statements they aren&rsquo;t
statements but expressions. That means that the following is valid in Haskell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">length&#39;</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;The list is &quot;</span> <span class="o">++</span> <span class="kr">case</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="kt">[]</span>    <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;empty</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">                                          [x]   -&gt; &quot;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">singleton</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">                                          (x:_) -&gt; &quot;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">long</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another thing that I really like is the <code>where</code> binding. It allows you to bind
an expression to a name in the scope of a function. That means that the <code>even</code>
function from earlier could be rewritten like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span><span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Integral</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="kr">where</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the <code>let</code> expression. In my opinion (this may well change as I
get to know the language better) it seems to be most usable in list
comprehensions, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">double</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="ow">&lt;-</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="kr">let</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learnt today. Writing this I got some of the syntax
wrong, but that&rsquo;s to expect when I&rsquo;ve just started out. I think I grasp the
concepts though, so that&rsquo;s really nice. Next up is recursion, which should be
a blast. But now I&rsquo;m going to sleep.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was informed roughly what I will be doing at work next semester (when I
say &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; I mean that the suggested work load probably is way through the
roof, and that it will need to be adjusted before the term starts), and one
of the things I&rsquo;ll be spending my time on is research. Since I am just a
project assistant and not a PhD student my research will be quite limited by
time (I will only spend 80 hours on it over the entire semester), but it&rsquo;s
something.</p>

<p>What my supervisor want me to do is have a look at a parsing library for
Haskell called <a href="https://github.com/aslatter/parsec">Parsec</a>. There&rsquo;s only one
problem; I don&rsquo;t know Haskell. Yet. So, today I set out on my journey to learn
my first functional programming language, and I thought I&rsquo;d let you in on the
fun. Starting with this post, I will be posting about my progress with learning
the (to me) new language. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be getting something out of it, maybe
not. I&rsquo;m going to do it regardless.</p>

<p>So, to start off I want to mention the book I&rsquo;ll be learning from. It&rsquo;s called
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/lyah.htm">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, and is
published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. I&rsquo;ll write a review
of the book once I&rsquo;m done working though it.</p>

<p>Now, without further adue, let&rsquo;s delve into Haskell! (Note that I&rsquo;m mostly by
no means going to try to teach you Haskell, I&rsquo;m mostly just going to ramble on
about things I find weird about the language)</p>

<p>As a C and Python programmer, Haskell seems quite strange. It feel a lot like
Python in the way that it is written, but some things are strange. For
instance, the following is perfectly legitimate syntax for Haskell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">foo</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">if</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="kr">then</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="kr">else</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First of all, this is a function declaration and not a variable assingment. But
that&rsquo;s not the main thing that&rsquo;s bugging me about this. It&rsquo;s that the <code>if</code>
itself <em>returns</em> a value, which I can then add <code>1</code> to. As the book expresses
it: there is no such thing as an <code>if</code> <em>statement</em> in Haksell, there are <code>if</code>
<em>expressions</em> instead. Very strange.</p>

<p>Another thing that is qutie odd, but does make sense, is the way list items are
accessed. Coming from imperative languages, I am used to the <code>list[index]</code>
syntax if I want to access a list element. However, that kind of syntax
wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in Haskell, since Haskell has no variables. Insted the
syntax is</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">!!</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This would fetch <code>4</code>, which is the third item of the list. To finish off, I
want to mention a thing that&rsquo;s really weird with Haskell, but it&rsquo;s something
I wish all languages did: argument pattern matching. For instance, to build a
(probably poor) summing function one could do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum&#39;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="kt">:</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">sum&#39;</span> <span class="n">xs</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum&#39;</span> <span class="kt">[]</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This basically means that the function <code>sum'</code> takes a list, and puts the first
element in it&rsquo;s own variable. It then adds that to the recursive call to the
function itself. Once the list is empty (the <code>sum' []</code>), <code>0</code> is returned. No
<code>if</code> expressions, nothing. Just matching the input with an empty list.
Bloody brilliant!</p>

<p>Anyway, this post is already way longer than it should, so I&rsquo;m going to sign
off now.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know, I know. I am terrible at this blogging thing. I will try to post more
frequently in the future, and I actually have a plan on how to do that. But
that&rsquo;s for another post. Today I want to talk about winter!</p>

<p>Winter is by far my favorite time of year; you get to drink hot cocoa, wear
cozy clothes, and you can go outside wihtout dying from the heat. It&rsquo;s the
bee&rsquo;s knees! But what would winter be without a good advent calendar?</p>

<p>I am of course talking about <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. It&rsquo;s
a great project to keep your hacker spirit alive over the holidays. Last year
I tried to follow, and I did for a few days before I lost track of it, but this
year I&rsquo;m going to finish. So far I&rsquo;ve finished all the tasks, and I have
learned a couple of things along the way (how to do multithreading i Python
for example). If you haven&rsquo;t already checked it out, you should click the
link above right now and join the fun!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all I wanted to say. If you&rsquo;re interested, all my solutions
are available on <a href="https://github.com/Psyberion/adventofcode2016">github</a>, so
go check that out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s finally time for me to post my first book review! As mentioned I&rsquo;ve wanted
to do this for quite some time, both to get some more posting here on the blog
done and to give me an incentive to actually read the books I buy. So here it
is, the first book review on this blog!</p>

<p>The book I&rsquo;ve (actually) read is
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/tlcl"><em>The Linux Commandline</em></a> by <strong>William E. Shotts,
Jr.</strong>, published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. The book is
aimed at people who have just installed Linux and is clueless about where to go
from there. As such I am quite a bit outside of the target audience, but despite
this I found the book to be a very good read (I mean, I finished it&hellip;).</p>

<p><em>The Linux Commandline</em> is divided into four parts: Learning the shell;
Configuration and the Environment; Common Tasks and Essential Tools; and Writing
Shell Scripts. Just looking at this it is clear that the book covers a great
many subjects in the world of the Linux commandline. As I said it is aimed at
complete Linux newbies, and as such it begins at a very basic level. In the very
first chapter the concept of a <em>shell</em> is explained, along with things such as
the fact that the shell tells you that no command was found if you try to
execute random letters. Once that is dealt with the book works it&rsquo;s way from
commands like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> to more complex commands like <code>sed</code> and how to write
regular expressions for <code>sed</code>. It covers pipes, redirection, searching with
<code>find</code> and touches on editing with my personal favorite editor Vim. When all
these topics are covered, the author shows how to glue it all together using
<code>if</code>-statements, <code>for</code>-loops and shell functions to build complete shell
scripts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the book covers a lot, but the big question is whether or not
it does it well. To that my answer is yes. As mentioned I am far from the target
audience with 10 years of working with Linux in my luggage. Despite this I
actually learned a thing or two from the book. A large part of the book could be
skimmed, such as descriptions of what <code>ls -l</code> and <code>ls -a</code> do, but some chapters
were completely new such as how to print files to paper via the CLI. Apart from
the content being very fleshed out it is also well written in a style that is
easy to read and learn from. Descriptions are clear and the vast majority of all
commands covered are also used in an example, so that it is easy for the reader
to follow along and try things out.</p>

<p>To conclude this is a book that according to me is clearly worth the $39.95. I
only own it as an e-book, but I am tempted to buy a paperback as well to have a
physical copy. It is well written, clearly describes how to efficiently work
with the shell on a basic to intermediate level, and I think that if everyone
who tried Linux would take the time to work through this their Linux experience
would be a lot better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As probably nobody with even the slightest interest in gaming has missed, the
hype of the year has finally come out: No Man&rsquo;s Sky. The game where there is an
infinite, procedurally generated universe to discover and explore, creatures
created not by careful design but by artifical evolution to marvel at, alien
cultures to encounter and interact with! Over at
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame">/r/NoMansSkyTheGame</a> people have
torn their hair in anticipation of this game. And I must admit, I was quite
excited about it as well. Becuase it sounds pretty cool, doesn&rsquo;t it? With all
that exploration to do, all those discoveries to be made.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve tried. I really have. I&rsquo;ve spent ten hours over the weekend trying to
get into it, but I just can&rsquo;t. The game is horrendous. I&rsquo;ve had it. It&rsquo;s not
just that there&rsquo;s nothing to do in the game, it&rsquo;s also that everything is
exactly the same and nothing makes sense! For instance I visited a quite
chilly planet, so to speak. The temperature was at -30 to -60 centrigrades.
Despite this there were liquid water! Fancy that, no ice! When I then fly over
to another planet in the same solar system I notice something interesting; the
exact same plants as I found on another planet <em>in another solar system</em> lives
there. Not something similar, the <em>exact</em> same but with a (presumably)
different name. Not to mention the creatures created by the artificial
evolution.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Britbongreturns/status/765190830894317568">This</a> post
by <a href="https://twitter.com/Britbongreturns">@Britbongreturns</a> sums it up quite
nicely, so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this post, let&rsquo;s go over a few of the selling points on the
game&rsquo;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/#app_reviews_hash">Steam page</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant
 danger and action</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well this is just a downright lie: The planets may be procedurally
generated, and therefore unique, but apparently reusing every resource
there is in the game isn&rsquo;t covered by this. Also, if there is so much
danger and action, how come I haven&rsquo;t experienced neither danger nor
action?</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading
 screens, and no limits.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is actually true! There are no loading screens! Instead there is the
most terrible texture popping I have ever seen! Not only does it pop in
textures as you&rsquo;re closing up to them, but it &ldquo;unpops&rdquo; them as well; if you
have mined out a huge pillar of e.g. gold then you&rsquo;ll still see it at a
distance! Terrible!</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a
 journey towards it</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huh, the more you know. Apart from the exposition given right here I haven&rsquo;t
been given any incentive so far for going to the center of the galaxy.
Weird.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To conclude this rant I&rsquo;d like to say that I didn&rsquo;t want a 60€ game with
horrible &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; in it. I already own a game like that: Spore! So now I&rsquo;m
done with this disappointment. I&rsquo;m going back to buying small, unknown indie
games via <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">HumbleBundle</a>, at least I usually
enjoy at least they&rsquo;re enjoyable for the most part.</p>
