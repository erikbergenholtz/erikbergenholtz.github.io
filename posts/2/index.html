  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, here we are agian. Yet another change of blogging platform. This one is
here to stay, at least of a while. I promise.</p>

<p>So why do I change once again? Well, the reason is simple: time. I have a lot
of things I <em>want</em> to add to my old blog, like commenting and possibly RSS and
stuff, but I don&rsquo;t really have the time. So I went looking for a suitable
platform, and found this. Like my old blog this renders Markdown, but it also
does syntax highlighting and stuff more efficiently than my old blog. So this
is what I&rsquo;ll go with.</p>

<p>Am I going to abandon my old blog then? No, not quite. I don&rsquo;t plan on using
it as my blogging platform anytime in the near future, but I do plan to keep it
alive and well inside a VM and keep developing it. So maybe I&rsquo;ll use it again
in the future, who knows? But for now it&rsquo;s only going to be a side project, the
progress of which I&rsquo;ll share here.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;m going to migrate all the old posts to this
platform, but it might take a bit of time because of formatting differences
and stuff. Until next time!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are again, I&rsquo;ve actually read another book. That makes four this year,
out of which three have been on some form of computer related topic. So my
New Year&rsquo;s resolution to read twelve books this year is actually looking like
it&rsquo;s doable.</p>

<p>But enough beating around be bush, if you&rsquo;re reading this it&rsquo;s because you want
to know what I think of <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ace/media/gray-hat-hacking.pdf">Gray Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</a>,
so here&rsquo;s what I think of it: I&rsquo;m not sure. I think that I may be a poor judge,
because I was expecting more than I got. See, this book is quite praised in
hacker circles, at least as I remember it from the days when I used to hang out
in hacker forums. It is one of <em>the</em> books you should read if you want to get
into the world of hacking. So knowing this I obviously expected miracles, more
or less, when I started reading. Unfortunately, that is not what <em>I</em> got.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I want to point out a few things. Firstly, I have not
read this cover to cover. I&rsquo;ve read the better part of it, but I&rsquo;ve skipped
quite some text that I didn&rsquo;t have a need for right now. This mostly involves
fluff like how to use specific tools, what it means to be an <em>Ethical Hacker</em>.
Secondly, since I have an education in computer security where I have actually
had this book as course literature (I didn&rsquo;t read it at the time though), I knew
a lot of these things before. This is part of the reason why I didn&rsquo;t get the
miracle I was expecting. With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get into the meat of'er!</p>

<p>The book quite hefty at 672 pages. It covers <em>a lot</em> of topics, ranging from how
to report found vulnerabilities to basic programming (I&rsquo;m coming back to this
later) to quite advanced tricks to get around protection schemes. This is why I
believe that it&rsquo;s considered such a good book to read if you want to enter the
world of hacking; it does give an introduction to a great many things. However,
some of these fields are covered so briefly that they might as well have left
them out. This includes SQL and XSS injections, that are only really touched
upon. Other topics, buffer overflows in particular, are elaborated on. The
explanations of these topics are well composed, with working(ish) examples,
complete with code, explanations and references. This allow you to follow along
for the most part, which is great! As opposed to Black Hat Python, where the
code examples comes first and the explanation afterwards, here the explanation
of the vulnerability comes first and the exploit is then iteratively
constructed, showing all steps along the way. The only real problem I have with
this is that their type setting for the code segment is quite bad, and sometimes
separate lines are printed on the same line. This is really a minor complaint
though.</p>

<p>One thing that is not the books fault, but decreases the value of it none the
less, is that it is a book and it&rsquo;s written in 2011. This means that some of the
things brought up in it is no longer possible, or no longer relevant. For
instance, the book walked throught the process of injecting shellcode via the
<code>.dtors</code> section of a program (I&rsquo;m not explaining that further, not in this
post at least). That section is replaces with <code>.fini_array</code> since GCC 4.7, which
works differently and makes the covered attack impossible. There&rsquo;s likely a
similar attack that exploits the new format, but for obvious reasons the book
doesn&rsquo;t cover it. There are a number of such instances, but as mentioned it&rsquo;s
not the fault of the authors but rather the ever-changing nature of the field.</p>

<p>Another thing that I find strange about the book is it&rsquo;s pacing. It&rsquo;s covering
fairly advanced attacks and how to construct your own shellcode, while at the
same time covering basic programming. This section is really quite short and as
I&rsquo;m quite adept at programming I only skimmed it, but I could see that it was on
the level of &ldquo;every C program needs a function called <code>main()</code>&rdquo;. In other words,
that part of the text was aimed at someone who has never seen a line of code.
This is odd to me, as security is no basic topic. Sure, there are a ton of
script kiddies who run around on the interwebs thinking they&rsquo;re 1337 hax0rz
because the figured out how to download LOIC (or whatever is the latest and
greatest DDoS tool now-a-days), but this is a book that aims to educate security
professionals. Demanding a certain amount of previous knowledge of how C,
memory and such works would not be too much to ask in my opinion. Especially
when, as I said, shellcode construction is covered. This involves writing
(short) C programs that do what you want, compiling them and removing any
unnecessary ASM that the compiler added, only to then assemble and extract the
opcodes. In other words, it&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;d be able to do confidently if you
don&rsquo;t know C before you start reading.</p>

<p>Apart from this I like the book. I didn&rsquo;t get much out of it, but that is
because I already knew most of it. The parts I didn&rsquo;t know where quite
interesting to read about, and as I said it covers the topics well. Because of
this I&rsquo;d agree with the statement that this is one of <em>the books</em> to read if you
want to get going with <em>ethical</em> hacking. Do yourself a favour and wait until
you&rsquo;re at least somewhat proficient in C and x86 assembler before you pick up
the book though, as you might have a hard time understanding some of the
examples otherwise.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, I hope you enjoyed this.. reviewish. Until next time,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I dug my teeth into a new piece of literature:
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython">Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters</a>
by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent more then
five minutes on this site probably knows that No Starch is my favorite publisher
and that I think they usually publish books of high quality. Spoiler alert; this
book does not fall in that category.</p>

<p>Before I go on, I want to give a short disclaimer though. This is by no means a
<em>book review</em>. I have not read the whole thing cover to cover (yet), I have just
read the first few chapters and put it away because I really disliked the way
the author&rsquo;s style of teaching. I plan on reading the full thing at some point
and give a <em>proper</em> review, but I want to give some kind of a heads up for
anyone reading. So, let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

<p>First off, I was quite excited to read this. I enjoy working with Python, and
would say that it&rsquo;s probably the language I use the most. I&rsquo;m also quite
interested in computer security, and one of my previous goals was to become a
professional pentester. So obviously this book was quite appealing. The book is
written by Justin Seitz, who at the time of writing writing the book worked at
Immunity Inc with security analysis. He&rsquo;s also written another book for No
Starch Press called <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/ghpython.htm">Gray Hat Python</a>
(which I&rsquo;ll get arount to reading Soon™), so it all seems good! The book covers
a range of topics, from how to set up the testing environment to how to automate
forenic tasks, spread trojans via github, and playing around with the network.
From just looking at it from the outside, it looks like a really nice book (it
has a nice cover too!)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as the saying goes, you should not judge a book by it&rsquo;s cover.
While the text itself holds up to the quality of the other No Starch books I&rsquo;ve
read, the actual <em>content</em> of the book does not. Each section in the book
describes a problem, like needing a quick way to send commands to a compromised
server. The text then guides you through a solution to the problem, and this is
where the problems start. Firstly, the solution is presented <em>before</em> the
explanation of even the steps to take. This might seem like a small issue, and
maybe it is for some, but I prefer to give it a go myself first, <em>before</em> I look
at a solution. I know this might be hard with books like this, but just listing
what the solution must do isn&rsquo;t too much to ask, is it? The second thing that
bugged me, which is what made me put the book away, is the actual explanations
themselves. They are really short, and don&rsquo;t explain much at all. To showcase
this, let&rsquo;s have a look at the following example:</p>

<p>A simple enough python class, that is used to build an SSH-server to send
commands through to the client, which is uploaded to the victim. The
explanation for the code is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>just like we did earlier in the chapter, and then SSHinize it</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not the first thing the book covered on SSH using the Paramiko library,
but a class was never used. Also, none of the Paramiko flags were used earlier.
But their names are good, so it&rsquo;s easy enough to understand the function of the
Server-class anyway. Now, let&rsquo;s skip forward in the code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>None of this has been used before, but it&rsquo;s all pretty obvious; set <code>client</code> (
which is an already connected socket) as the socket on which to transport the
SSH session, add a keyfile, build a server-object and use that as the server.
The explanation for this is</p>

<blockquote><p>configure the authentication methods</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, what? I guess this is technically correct, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain
<em>anything</em>. Sure, it&rsquo;s not that hard to understand, but still. The thing that
really annoys me is this: <code>bhSession.start_server(server=server)</code>. <code>bhSession</code>
is a paramiko-object of some kind, and to that objects member function
<code>start_server()</code> we pass our homebrewed Server-class. This means that, since
it will be used by a function in a library, the Server-class have to have some
functions and variables that should respond to different things. These are quite
important pieces of information if you want to build something yourself rather
than just copy and paste from a book. Alas, if I want to learn that I have to
consult the Paramiko documentation, because there isn&rsquo;t an explanation within
sight in the book.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind reading documentation, but I do mind paying $34 for a book
that supposedly should teach me something, only to be forced to read open
documentation if I want more understanding than copying, pasting and running can
give. Fortunately I got the book in a HumbleBundle, so I hardly payed for it.
And maybe it gets better later in the book, but right now I don&rsquo;t have time to
find out. As I said, this is very much a first imporession of the book and I
will get back to it. I just really think it&rsquo;s a shame that they didn&rsquo;t make it
twice as long (it&rsquo;s just short of 165 pages) and elaborated on the explanations
more, so that you don&rsquo;t need to consult the documentation to understand what&rsquo;s
going on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for my rant on this book. I&rsquo;ll revisit it Sometime™ and write a real
review. But for now this will have to do. I&rsquo;ll have a review on another book I
recently read shortly, but until then</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but now I am finally done reading
<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, so it is
time for me not only to get coding, but also to review the book!</p>

<p>Haskell is a language that I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing for quite some time, but I have
hesitated to get started with it due to it being a functional programming
language. As a guy coming from a mainly imperative background (I do most work
in C or Python), this is quite different and without a good tutorial it seemed
quite inaccessible. Luckily for me, Learn You a Haskell showed up on
<a href="https://humblebundle.com">HumbleBundle</a> a while ago, so I took the opportunity
to buy it.</p>

<p>The book is aimed at people like me: people experienced in programming, but new
to functional programming. The book guides the reader though the core concepts
of Haskell in a conversational tone that is riddled with examples. The language
is easy to follow, and new concepts are described clearly. The powerfulness of
the language is shown both through descriptions in the text, but also with the
examples. In general I would say that it&rsquo;s a really good book that is very
worth reading.</p>

<p>However, the book has one downside; its lack of exercises. As mentioned, it is
full of examples, and they do great job at showing how things work and how
powerful the language is when used correctly. Unfortunately there are no clear
exercises. Some of the examples are extended through description, where the
actual implementation of the extension is left as an exercise to the reader,
but as someone who want to learn how to work with the language and have never
done anything functional before it is hard to come up with exercises for
yourself. I really do think that the book would benefit a lot from having
explicit tasks to do yourself at the end of each chapter. As it is now, I am
quite confident that I understand the concepts of the language after reading
the book, but I am far from confident with coding in it. Of course I would not
have become a Haskell wizard by reading the book even if it did have exercises,
but I think I would&rsquo;ve been closer.</p>

<p>Regardless I think that it is a really good book, and a really good
introduction to both Haskell and functional programming, and I am looking
forward to getting to know Haskell in a more practical way. As a final note
I&rsquo;d like to recommend it if you&rsquo;re interested in learning Haskell. There are a
lot of very large and crooked questionmarks surrounding the world of functional
programming if you&rsquo;re from an imperative or object oriented background, but the
book does a great job of straightening those into exclamation marks.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to delve into the next book, which will be
<a href="http://users.metu.edu.tr/serge/courses/111-2011/textbook-math111.pdf">How to Prove it</a>,
a review of that will come when I&rsquo;m done working through it.</p>

<p>Until the next time,</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

you&rsquo;re not going to keep. Or maybe you will! I for one will really try to keep
mine, because I really want to make myself a better person. So what are my
new year&rsquo;s resolutions going to be?</p>

<p>First off, and I know that I&rsquo;ve said this a few times before, I am going to
read more. For reals this time. Thing is that I have a ton of books, both
fictional and factual, that I&rsquo;ve been eager to read. However, I have a severe
case of &ldquo;積ん読&rdquo; or <em>tsundoku</em>. It&rsquo;s a Japanese word for &ldquo;buying books
but not reading them&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku">seriously</a>).
Now I want to stop having this.. &ldquo;condition&rdquo;, I want to start reading. Not only
because books are expensive and I should not spend money unnecessarily, but
also because what I do when I don&rsquo;t read is quite stupid. Usually, I just
imgur or reddit, or play some game. Sure, gaming is good for relaxing, but so
is learning new things. So, my plan is to spend less time browsing reddit and
more time reading things. So, new year&rsquo;s resolution number one is that I shall
read one book a month.</p>

<p>The second one is something I am going to do together with my girlfriend. We&rsquo;re
going to not consume any unnecessary sugar for 100 days. This means no candy,
soda, alcohol, cookies or anything else like that for one hundred days, i.e.
until April 9th. We&rsquo;re not going to over do it, so sugar in food products is
OK.</p>

<p>Lastly there&rsquo;s the obligatory &ldquo;get in shape&rdquo; resolution. I have these fancy
(but ugly) Vibram Fivefinger shoes that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been using too little. So I&rsquo;m
going to take up running again, at least once a week. Also I&rsquo;m going to try to
start lifting weights down at the gym. I&rsquo;m doing this not only to become a
Greek god (which I obviously will become), but also to relieve some stress.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s my three new year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading one book a month, be it fictional or educational</li>
<li>No excess sugar for 100 days</li>
<li>Start running at least once a week</li>
</ul>


<p>So that&rsquo;s it for this post. Sorry for deluding you into thinking I was getting
a 4k monitor or something that cool for the new year. Hopefully I will update
my rig during the year, and I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on that, but for now this is
all.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought that the next post I was going to do would be one on higher order
functions. In fact, I started writing one a couple of times, but it just didn&rsquo;t
seem necessary. Why was that? Well, it all actually made sense. I had a read
through the chapter, and the theory wan&rsquo;t that hard. Once I had also
reimplemented the fold and scan functions recusively myself I felt that I had
a quite solid grip on higher order functions. And man, are they powerful!</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve moved forward, past modules and into the end of defining my own
data types. While that is itself quite straight forward, there are quite
a few things that aren&rsquo;t exactly odd, but they need to be remebered, so I&rsquo;m
jotting it down here.</p>

<p>To star off, if you want to define a new data type you use the <code>data</code> keyword.
It looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Green</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a data type called <code>TrafficLight</code>, of which we can create the
values <code>Red</code>, <code>Yellow</code> and <code>Green</code> using it&rsquo;s <em>value constructors</em>. While this
is a perfectly fine class, we can&rsquo;t print it to the terminal, read it from a
string, order it or check if it&rsquo;s values are equal at present. To fix that we
could do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Read</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Ord</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This allow us to do everything stated above. The <code>Eq</code> type class (we&rsquo;ll get to
that later) allow us to equate elements. The default behaviour is that
<code>Red == Red</code> is true, while <code>Red == Green</code> is false. The <code>Ord</code> allow us to
order the values. The default behaviour for this type class is that the value
constructors <em>to the left</em> are <strong>smaller</strong> than the ones on the right. I.e., in
this example <code>Red &lt; Green</code> is true while <code>Yellow &gt; Green</code> is false, because of
the order they&rsquo;re defined in the type definition.</p>

<p>It is also possible to define a new data type using a class constructor. This
is something that&rsquo;s been used in the type definitions of functions through out
the book, and isn&rsquo;t that strange really. For instance, a simple binary search
tree could be implemented like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Ord</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using this kind of declaration, it is possible to store any data type in the
tree, as long as it is orderable and equatable. Which makes sense, since it&rsquo;s a
BST.</p>

<p>We can also use the register syntax to add some additional context to our data
type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Person</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">firstname</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lastname</span>  <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">birthyear</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>
</span><span class='line'>              <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All this is quite straight forward, if a bit much to take in all at once. But
it quite makes sense anyway. Now, let&rsquo;s get into the really strange things.
Let&rsquo;s start off with instances.</p>

<p>Earlier I showed that in order to make the value constructors of a class
equatable (is that even a word? Sounds weird) you need to derive the <code>Eq</code> type
class in your data type. This imposes some default behaviour, as described. If
you for some reason aren&rsquo;t happy with this default behaviour you can go around
it by making your type an <em>instance</em> of <code>Eq</code>, like this (I&rsquo;m using the
TrafficLight type for this example):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span> <span class="kt">TrafficLight</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Red</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Yellow</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kt">Green</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This basically says that <code>Red == Red</code> is true, and so is <code>Yellow == Yellow</code> and
<code>Green == Green</code>. All other combinations, however, are false. This overrides
how <code>Eq</code> typically behaves (and in this case, replaces the behaviour with an
identical behaviour). I can really see how this is useful, as it bares some
resemblance to defining your own equality operator (or the like; this works for
any type class) in C++.</p>

<p>Next up is actual type classes, and inheritance from those. Coming from a (sort
of) object oriented (I bloody hate object oriented programming..) background,
this seems quite strange. A class in Haskell isn&rsquo;t like a class in C++; a bunch
of functions and variables crammed together into one name. In Haskel, it&rsquo;s just
a collection of type definitions for functions. In other words, it&rsquo;s kind of
like a C++ class with no variables and only virtual functions. If you have a
class that itself is a type constructor, then you can make the class a subclass
of another class. For instance, the <code>Ord</code> class is a subclass of <code>Eq</code>,
because it makes sense that any data types that are orderable are also
equatable.</p>

<p>As a grand finale of this monstrosity of a post, we have functors. Oh dear, how
weird functors seemed at first. A type class that is meant for things that can
be mapped. It sounded so strange at first, but once I realized how it could
be utilized for any data type that can either be empty, or contain something,
it was quite obvious how awesome this was. For instance, the <code>Tree</code> I
defined earlier has the following definition:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">derives</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, say I want to write a function that traverses all of the tree and applies
an arbitrary function to the values of each node. Using functors it&rsquo;s as easy
as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">instance</span> <span class="kt">Functor</span> <span class="kt">Tree</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="kr">_</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">EmptyTree</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Node</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fmap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! I tell Haskell that I want to make the Tree type an instance of the
Functor class, I define how I want the <code>fmap</code> function to act on the tree and
as a result I can now multiply all node values of a tree of integers like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">fmap</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">tree</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It goes over the tree and builds a new tree. Writing this I realize that doing
this with a normal function would actually work the exact same way, but I am
sure that functors have some advantage over normal functions that I just don&rsquo;t
see with my inexperienced eyes.</p>

<p>So, after a long read (both for me and you) we&rsquo;re finally at the end of this
post (and the chapters on types and classes in &ldquo;Learn you a Haskell&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s
been quite the journey, and it has taken me a couple of days to get here, which
makes sense considering I&rsquo;ve had to forget everything I know about classes. But
Haskell&rsquo;s type system seems really cool, and I look forward to getting to know
it better! But now I&rsquo;ll take a break. Until next time,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve just finished a small project that I wanted to share with the rest of you.
What I&rsquo;ve done is a home screen for your browser that at least I think is
pretty good looking (see screenshot below) and faily easy to customize. The
page uses a number of simple JavaScripts (that could probably be improved) to
print a nifty, randomized title on the page, as well as dynamically build links
to the sites you frequent.</p>

<p>If you think this looks nice and want to try it out, all instructions you
should need to get it up and running to your liking is on the
<a href="https://github.com/Psyberion/homepage">repo on github</a>, so I&rsquo;m not going to
say more about it, but leave you with a screenshot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are again, another post about Haskell. To star off I just want to say
that I am having a blast learning this, and that I think I am getting the
hang of it. I&rsquo;ve gone through recursion today, which isn&rsquo;t really a new concept
to me, but it&rsquo;s tricky to know what to do in a completely new language.
However, I managed to write all example function from the book on my own, which
I think is a sign that I am starting to get this. For instance, I came up with
this solution to writing quicksort:</p>

<p>So the only real differences is that I have one unnecessary case in my pattern
matching (<code>quicksort [x] = [x]</code>) and that I use <code>where</code> instead of <code>let</code>. I&rsquo;m
quite satisfied with that!</p>

<p>The next chapter is on currying, folds and other strange things. From what I
remember, these things all appeared very odd to me, so I think I&rsquo;ll take that
tomorrow instead. So I guess I didn&rsquo;t really learn that much today, but it&rsquo;s
nice to see that I am getting closer to understanding this language.</p>

<p>Anyway, expect a monster update when I&rsquo;m done with the next chapter, because
there&rsquo;ll be a lot to anchor in my mind by writing about it. Until then,</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My mission to learn Haskell goes on, and I&rsquo;ve now  read about functions. As
Haskell is a purley functional language, it makes sense that functions are
quite important and well developed in the language. There are a lot of things
I really like with the way Haskell does functions that are strange in the eyes
of an imperative programmer, and I&rsquo;m going to jot some of it down here to try
to reinforce my own understanding of it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <em>guards</em>. In Haskell, a guard is basically a large if-else
statement. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">function</span> <span class="n">var</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">statement</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">statement</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For instance, if I want to build a function that returns <code>True</code> if the input is
even I could write it like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span><span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Integral</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This makes for code that is quite easy to read, especially when there are a lot
of different cases to match against. Speaking of cases, there are of course
switch-case statements in Haskell too, but just like if-statements they aren&rsquo;t
statements but expressions. That means that the following is valid in Haskell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">length&#39;</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;The list is &quot;</span> <span class="o">++</span> <span class="kr">case</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="kr">of</span> <span class="kt">[]</span>    <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="s">&quot;empty</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">                                          [x]   -&gt; &quot;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">singleton</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">                                          (x:_) -&gt; &quot;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">long</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another thing that I really like is the <code>where</code> binding. It allows you to bind
an expression to a name in the scope of a function. That means that the <code>even</code>
function from earlier could be rewritten like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span><span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Integral</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">even</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">True</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">False</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="kr">where</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">`</span><span class="n">mod</span><span class="p">`</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the <code>let</code> expression. In my opinion (this may well change as I
get to know the language better) it seems to be most usable in list
comprehensions, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">double</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="ow">&lt;-</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="kr">let</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="ow">=</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learnt today. Writing this I got some of the syntax
wrong, but that&rsquo;s to expect when I&rsquo;ve just started out. I think I grasp the
concepts though, so that&rsquo;s really nice. Next up is recursion, which should be
a blast. But now I&rsquo;m going to sleep.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was informed roughly what I will be doing at work next semester (when I
say &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; I mean that the suggested work load probably is way through the
roof, and that it will need to be adjusted before the term starts), and one
of the things I&rsquo;ll be spending my time on is research. Since I am just a
project assistant and not a PhD student my research will be quite limited by
time (I will only spend 80 hours on it over the entire semester), but it&rsquo;s
something.</p>

<p>What my supervisor want me to do is have a look at a parsing library for
Haskell called <a href="https://github.com/aslatter/parsec">Parsec</a>. There&rsquo;s only one
problem; I don&rsquo;t know Haskell. Yet. So, today I set out on my journey to learn
my first functional programming language, and I thought I&rsquo;d let you in on the
fun. Starting with this post, I will be posting about my progress with learning
the (to me) new language. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be getting something out of it, maybe
not. I&rsquo;m going to do it regardless.</p>

<p>So, to start off I want to mention the book I&rsquo;ll be learning from. It&rsquo;s called
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/lyah.htm">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, and is
published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. I&rsquo;ll write a review
of the book once I&rsquo;m done working though it.</p>

<p>Now, without further adue, let&rsquo;s delve into Haskell! (Note that I&rsquo;m mostly by
no means going to try to teach you Haskell, I&rsquo;m mostly just going to ramble on
about things I find weird about the language)</p>

<p>As a C and Python programmer, Haskell seems quite strange. It feel a lot like
Python in the way that it is written, but some things are strange. For
instance, the following is perfectly legitimate syntax for Haskell:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">foo</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">if</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="kr">then</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="kr">else</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First of all, this is a function declaration and not a variable assingment. But
that&rsquo;s not the main thing that&rsquo;s bugging me about this. It&rsquo;s that the <code>if</code>
itself <em>returns</em> a value, which I can then add <code>1</code> to. As the book expresses
it: there is no such thing as an <code>if</code> <em>statement</em> in Haksell, there are <code>if</code>
<em>expressions</em> instead. Very strange.</p>

<p>Another thing that is qutie odd, but does make sense, is the way list items are
accessed. Coming from imperative languages, I am used to the <code>list[index]</code>
syntax if I want to access a list element. However, that kind of syntax
wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in Haskell, since Haskell has no variables. Insted the
syntax is</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">!!</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This would fetch <code>4</code>, which is the third item of the list. To finish off, I
want to mention a thing that&rsquo;s really weird with Haskell, but it&rsquo;s something
I wish all languages did: argument pattern matching. For instance, to build a
(probably poor) summing function one could do the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum&#39;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="kt">:</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">sum&#39;</span> <span class="n">xs</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum&#39;</span> <span class="kt">[]</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This basically means that the function <code>sum'</code> takes a list, and puts the first
element in it&rsquo;s own variable. It then adds that to the recursive call to the
function itself. Once the list is empty (the <code>sum' []</code>), <code>0</code> is returned. No
<code>if</code> expressions, nothing. Just matching the input with an empty list.
Bloody brilliant!</p>

<p>Anyway, this post is already way longer than it should, so I&rsquo;m going to sign
off now.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
