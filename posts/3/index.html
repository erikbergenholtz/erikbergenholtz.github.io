  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s finally time for me to post my first book review! As mentioned I&rsquo;ve wanted
to do this for quite some time, both to get some more posting here on the blog
done and to give me an incentive to actually read the books I buy. So here it
is, the first book review on this blog!</p>

<p>The book I&rsquo;ve (actually) read is
<a href="https://www.nostarch.com/tlcl"><em>The Linux Commandline</em></a> by <strong>William E. Shotts,
Jr.</strong>, published by <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>. The book is
aimed at people who have just installed Linux and is clueless about where to go
from there. As such I am quite a bit outside of the target audience, but despite
this I found the book to be a very good read (I mean, I finished it&hellip;).</p>

<p><em>The Linux Commandline</em> is divided into four parts: Learning the shell;
Configuration and the Environment; Common Tasks and Essential Tools; and Writing
Shell Scripts. Just looking at this it is clear that the book covers a great
many subjects in the world of the Linux commandline. As I said it is aimed at
complete Linux newbies, and as such it begins at a very basic level. In the very
first chapter the concept of a <em>shell</em> is explained, along with things such as
the fact that the shell tells you that no command was found if you try to
execute random letters. Once that is dealt with the book works it&rsquo;s way from
commands like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> to more complex commands like <code>sed</code> and how to write
regular expressions for <code>sed</code>. It covers pipes, redirection, searching with
<code>find</code> and touches on editing with my personal favorite editor Vim. When all
these topics are covered, the author shows how to glue it all together using
<code>if</code>-statements, <code>for</code>-loops and shell functions to build complete shell
scripts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the book covers a lot, but the big question is whether or not
it does it well. To that my answer is yes. As mentioned I am far from the target
audience with 10 years of working with Linux in my luggage. Despite this I
actually learned a thing or two from the book. A large part of the book could be
skimmed, such as descriptions of what <code>ls -l</code> and <code>ls -a</code> do, but some chapters
were completely new such as how to print files to paper via the CLI. Apart from
the content being very fleshed out it is also well written in a style that is
easy to read and learn from. Descriptions are clear and the vast majority of all
commands covered are also used in an example, so that it is easy for the reader
to follow along and try things out.</p>

<p>To conclude this is a book that according to me is clearly worth the $39.95. I
only own it as an e-book, but I am tempted to buy a paperback as well to have a
physical copy. It is well written, clearly describes how to efficiently work
with the shell on a basic to intermediate level, and I think that if everyone
who tried Linux would take the time to work through this their Linux experience
would be a lot better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As probably nobody with even the slightest interest in gaming has missed, the
hype of the year has finally come out: No Man&rsquo;s Sky. The game where there is an
infinite, procedurally generated universe to discover and explore, creatures
created not by careful design but by artifical evolution to marvel at, alien
cultures to encounter and interact with! Over at
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame">/r/NoMansSkyTheGame</a> people have
torn their hair in anticipation of this game. And I must admit, I was quite
excited about it as well. Becuase it sounds pretty cool, doesn&rsquo;t it? With all
that exploration to do, all those discoveries to be made.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve tried. I really have. I&rsquo;ve spent ten hours over the weekend trying to
get into it, but I just can&rsquo;t. The game is horrendous. I&rsquo;ve had it. It&rsquo;s not
just that there&rsquo;s nothing to do in the game, it&rsquo;s also that everything is
exactly the same and nothing makes sense! For instance I visited a quite
chilly planet, so to speak. The temperature was at -30 to -60 centrigrades.
Despite this there were liquid water! Fancy that, no ice! When I then fly over
to another planet in the same solar system I notice something interesting; the
exact same plants as I found on another planet <em>in another solar system</em> lives
there. Not something similar, the <em>exact</em> same but with a (presumably)
different name. Not to mention the creatures created by the artificial
evolution.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Britbongreturns/status/765190830894317568">This</a> post
by <a href="https://twitter.com/Britbongreturns">@Britbongreturns</a> sums it up quite
nicely, so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this post, let&rsquo;s go over a few of the selling points on the
game&rsquo;s <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/#app_reviews_hash">Steam page</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant
 danger and action</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well this is just a downright lie: The planets may be procedurally
generated, and therefore unique, but apparently reusing every resource
there is in the game isn&rsquo;t covered by this. Also, if there is so much
danger and action, how come I haven&rsquo;t experienced neither danger nor
action?</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading
 screens, and no limits.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is actually true! There are no loading screens! Instead there is the
most terrible texture popping I have ever seen! Not only does it pop in
textures as you&rsquo;re closing up to them, but it &ldquo;unpops&rdquo; them as well; if you
have mined out a huge pillar of e.g. gold then you&rsquo;ll still see it at a
distance! Terrible!</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;<em>At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a
 journey towards it</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huh, the more you know. Apart from the exposition given right here I haven&rsquo;t
been given any incentive so far for going to the center of the galaxy.
Weird.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To conclude this rant I&rsquo;d like to say that I didn&rsquo;t want a 60â‚¬ game with
horrible &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; in it. I already own a game like that: Spore! So now I&rsquo;m
done with this disappointment. I&rsquo;m going back to buying small, unknown indie
games via <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">HumbleBundle</a>, at least I usually
enjoy at least they&rsquo;re enjoyable for the most part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There we are. I have finally gotten around to rebuilding my blog. I&rsquo;ve been
mearning to do that for a couple of months, but there&rsquo;s been a lot going on
lately so I haven&rsquo;t had the time. Until now. I must say that I&rsquo;m quite
satisfied how it turned out. There are still a couple of things I want to
add to it, like a commenting feature, but I&rsquo;ll get to that Later<TM>.</p>

<p>Now, I know I&rsquo;ve been worse at posting here than a cat is at barking, but
I&rsquo;m hoping to change that because I&rsquo;ve got a lot going on! First things first,
I&rsquo;m planning to work my way though all the books I buy for decoration, I mean
never get around to reading. What&rsquo;s more is that I&rsquo;m going to review them here
too! That means that I&rsquo;ll both start reading <em>and</em> posting more! Win-win!</p>

<p>Apart from reviewing printed teachings (and the odd piece of fiction maybe)
I also have a couple of hardware projects coming up which I&rsquo;m going to share
with you guys. So hopefully there&rsquo;ll be a lot going on here on the blog in
the future!</p>

<p>Right now I have to go to sleep though, so I&rsquo;ll see you next time!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been talking with a guy who found my
video of my first effects for the Shades interesting. By being
curious and questioning he sparked my interest in the shades again,
and I&rsquo;ve been quite busy lately making tutorials and developing
code for the shades. With this post I wanted to share my latest
videos of effects and tutorials. I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy!</p>

<p>I also, before bombarding you with youtube videos, want to say
that I have a larger project going on for the Shades. I&rsquo;ll be
unveiling it when I feel that it&rsquo;s polished enough, but I can
say that I am already quite satisfied with the results I&rsquo;ve gotten.
I&rsquo;m not sure what I want to do with it, but I guess I&rsquo;ll find that out.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s all I had to say. So until next time, enjoy the videos
and happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a while, and since I have something to share I
thought this might be a good time to pick up this blogging
business again.</p>

<p>I have started with Linux ricing, i.e. doing &ldquo;unecessary
modifications&rdquo; to my Linux system. I&rsquo;ve only been at it
for little more than a day, but I must say that I quite
enjoy it. There&rsquo;s a long way to go before I get to one
of the increadible ricings displayed over at
<a href="http://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a>, which is a
subreddit devoted to UNIX ricing. But I would say that
my current rice is at least a decent start.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dxNRCjU.png" alt="rice" /></p>

<p>I will keep up the good work, and hope to one day
reach a wizardly look on my Debian system!</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in trying my rice out,
or have a look at the dotfiles, they&rsquo;re all
<a href="https://github.com/Psyberion/ricedotfiles">available here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>They are here. The long wait has been ended. After a couple of months, I now sit here as a
proud owner of <a href="http://www.macetech.com/">Macetech</a>&rsquo;s brilliant invention
the <a href="http://macetech.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=14&amp;products_id=59&amp;zenid=121ac6e4b163befd0309e0ecf8399002">RGB-shades</a>.
The shades is a piece of wearable electronics which consists of a controller and an LED-matrix
in the shape of a pair of shutter shades. They use the same microcontroller as an Arduino Pro, and
can as such be programmed like one.</p>

<p>I have not spent too much time programming them so far, but I can tell you that they are awesome.
I do not regret buying this one second, and I will enjoy hacking them. I plan on building a small
circuit to make them follow the beat of the music at least, and hopefully I can come up with
some other cool extension to them as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1OGp4D2f118">Meanwhile, enjoy my small &ldquo;demo&rdquo; of the patterns I&rsquo;ve programmed so far.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&rsquo;ve gotten my &ldquo;metal files&rdquo; from China now. I tried filing down one of the metal brush hairs I&rsquo;ve found which I want to use for material when making lockpicks. However, the files were rubbish. Sure, they are technically metal files as they are made from metal, but they are not build to work on metal. When I tried shaping a pick for myself the file I was trying out was filed down itself. I am a bit dissappointed, but I didn&rsquo;t really expect anything else considering the files are from China and cost about 1â‚¬ for 10pc. The moral of the story is that good tools are expensive, and that you should not order them from eBay but buy them from a hardware store. Oh well, it was worth a shot, better luck next time etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spring is here, and for a beginner lockpicker this is great news!
Why is it so? Because the streets are being cleaned. That means that machines
with large with large steel (spring steel even, I believe) brushes are roaming
the streets. This is good because all of a sudden the streets aren&rsquo;t littered
with just grovel, twigs and dust, they are also littered with (spring) steel
brush &ldquo;hairs&rdquo; which happen to be the perfect size to make your own lockpicking
tools. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve only found three, but I will keep my eyes open.</p>

<p>The plan now is to get myself some metal files. I&rsquo;ve found really cheap ones at
eBay, the Lord and Saviour, and I plan to buy these. As they&rsquo;re shipped from China
it might take a while for them to come to Sweden, but I guess I&rsquo;ll have to be patient.
I plan to clean up the &ldquo;hairs&rdquo; while I wait, and also try making a tension tool, which
really just requires a vice (which I already own).</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty much it for now. I&rsquo;ll write another post when I have made the tension
tool and tried that out. Until then!</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is Erik Bergenholtz, and I am a
security enthusiast and hacker living in Sweden. I hope to expand my website in
the future, but for now this blog will have to do.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I am a security enthusiast and hacker. I mostly enjoy
computer security, but physical security such as burglary alarms and lock
smithing is also quite amusing. This is what my blog will be about; security,
hacking, projects and perhaps the odd contemplation.</p>

<p>I am not sure what else to write in this first post, so I&rsquo;ll just leave it at
that. I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing some of my projects, and I hope you&rsquo;ll
enjoy reading about them.</p>

<p>Until then, <strong>happy hacking</strong>!</p>
